DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Farewell, but Forever in the Fight!<br>FROM:<br>Chief, National Tactical Integration Office<br>Run Date: 07/09/2003<br><br>(U) Thirty-nine years ago, I went to the Army recruiter and told him I wanted to be a spy, ala<br>James Bond. He didn't bat an eye. He just said, "Yuh can't be a spy yet son because you're too<br>young...Yuh might get carded in a bar and blow your cover." But...he had a great deal for me...<br>I could enlist in something called the Army Security Agency for four years and then they would<br>send me to spy school. I think I still have the scar tissue inside my gum where he set the hook.<br>:-) Well, what a fantastic journey it has been. I have served with some extraordinary military<br>and civilian people, and even some true heroes, during four assignments at NSA and more than<br>20 years overseas. I am humbly grateful to all who I have worked for and with for their vision,<br>talents, and sometimes most important of all, their patience with me.<br>(U) I started my SIGINT career with an initial assignment in Vietnam in 1965 with the 1st<br>Infantry Division; the famous "Big Red One." There were approximately 30,000 military<br>personnel in Vietnam at that time. When I left Vietnam for the last time in June 1968, there<br>were 530,000 personnel and we were well on the way to the final tally of over 50,000 Americans<br>killed and many more maimed for life. I survived combat without a scratch, including being<br>knocked on my butt during the TET offensive by a 122mm rocket and a horrible and<br>unforgettable battle for some numbered mountain top during the battle for Dak To in November<br>1967. I looked men in their alive eyes in the morning, and their dead eyes by the end of the<br>day. One of these men had personally ensured I was extracted by helicopter just hours before<br>the mortar company location I was using for short-range DF operations was overrun.<br>(U//FOUO) Why tell this war story now? It has been these memories that fueled my continuing<br>efforts to ensure SIGINT is In The Fight over the past 30-something years. However, once<br>again, we have our armed forces in grave danger. Moreover, for the first time in our history as a<br>country, we have enemies who have defined all Americans--no matter whether they were just<br>conceived or taking their last breaths due to old age--as legitimate targets to be destroyed!<br>Although sadly we continue to suffer combat losses in Iraq, a non-trivial difference is the<br>culmination of the efforts of our civilians, the military, and yes, even our partners in the<br>Congress, who have provided the phenomenal SIGINT capability we marshalled in support of<br>this latest fight. It is heartening to see the success of such things as the RSOC concept which I<br>worked on when we were trying to get the Congress to pay for it more than ten years ago.<br>Perhaps forgotten, or even unknown by most, is that the RSOC concept would never had seen<br>the light of day if it weren't for the courageous study done by MG Thomas Flynn in 1991-92<br>which postulated that if NSA and the services didn''t come up with a plan and resources, then<br>the SCEs (Service Cryptologic Elements) might not be viable in the future (meaning now!). We<br>continue to fight similar planning and resourcing battles today as we shake out the roles for SCE<br>involvement in target development and CNE/CNA (Computer Network Exploitation/Attack). As an<br>overall organization, we don't have national-tacitical integration just right, but we are light years<br>ahead of where we were almost 40 years ago.<br>(U//FOUO) I have enjoyed all of my assignments at NSAW and in the field for NSA. The work<br>hasn't always been fun, but it has always been accomplished by the finest citizens of the United<br>States and our allies. My last year as the Chief of the National Tactical Integration Office has<br>been especially rewarding because I have seen the workforce grow in their understanding of<br>what being in the fight really means, and their efforts to ensure it happens now and well into the<br>future. I also want to commend and thank the many partners in CRD and the other SID<br>organizations who are equally dedicated and use their considerable talents to ensure our armed<br>forces and deployed civilians are provided the information they need to accomplish their mission<br>with the least amount of threat possible. NSA is truly a national treasure...not because of its<br>technology... but because of its people. It has been my great honor to serve with you all!<br>Farewell, God Bless America, and...stay In The Fight!<br><br> </p>(U) p.s.
