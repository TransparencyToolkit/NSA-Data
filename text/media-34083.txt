(C//REL) Introduction; The European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden,
Germany, is NSA's primary communications hub in that part of the world, providing
communications connectivity, SIGINT collection, and data-flow services to NSAers,

warfighters and foreign partners in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, That's why
it is essential that ETC's capabilities keep up with the demand,,,

(C//REL) On 19 September, NSA officials* proudly hosted a ribbon-cutting
ceremony to officially mark the completion of GODLIKELESION - ETC's
Communications Center modernization project. The project initially began as a
limited effort to address challenges in cooling, equipment configuration, cable
management, and space in the room. Over time the effort grew into a much
broader joint project to completely rebuild the room from the ground up into a
state-of-the-art communications center,

(C//REL) Many years of high operations tempo and expansion had resulted in
incorrect rack configurations, poor airflow, insufficient rack size, installation
shortcuts, substandard safety and security measures, inconsistent cable
management, and lackluster documentation. In early 2010, over 150 power
supplies failed over several months, spurring an agreement between NSA's I&L,
Technology Directorate and ETC leadership to expand the scope of the
GODLIKELESION project to include a new supporting power infrastructure,

(C//REL) The GODLIKELESION project was completed in seven phases, all without
any interruption to the mission data flowing through ETC, Work alternated
between Enterprise IT Services (T3) and I&L elements to replace legacy flooring
and equipment racks; close partnering among the organizations allowed for timely
completion of the various phased tasks. As an example, all equipment supporting
communications for 27 Third Party partner dataflows was moved, re-installed and
documented within 12 days.

(U//FOUO) The work completed by I&L included new Uninterrupted Power Supply
(UPS), UPS distribution system, grounding system, raised access floor, rack power
distribution elements (PDE), and computer room air-conditioner (CRAC) units and

install 89 new equipment racks, move 253 pieces of equipment, install 5,668 feet of
new fiber, and create 1,076 pages of documentation, The new racks represent a
670% increase in available equipment space with cooling capacity doubled from
2009 conditions. The newly outfitted space will provide reliable and robust IT,
communications, and data-transport services for the foreseeable future.
