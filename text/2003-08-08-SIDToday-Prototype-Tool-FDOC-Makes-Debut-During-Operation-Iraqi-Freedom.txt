This prototype is called FOCUSED DEMONSTRATION Operational<br>Capability, or FDOC. How does it work? First, by displaying live, aggregated data, FDOC allows<br>us to compare our SIGINT posture (i.e. how we are using our collection and analytic resources)<br>with the state of the signal environment. With this information, SID can respond quickly to<br>changes in target behavior and adjust our collection and analysis as necessary.<br>(S//SI) Second, FDOC provides limited metrics that managers can use to gauge the overall<br>effectiveness of our SIGINT operations. It makes it possible for the manager to compare what<br>we are putting into an effort (collection and analysis resources expended) with the payoff (the<br>level of customer satisfaction). This can be used to make both real-time changes to tasking and<br>longer term, strategic decisions.<br>(S//SI) The current version (Increment 3) of FDOC was deployed to the National Security<br>Operations Center (NSOC) and Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) the week<br>of 16 June, and proved to be a valuable, timesaving tool. The Cryptologic Mission Management<br>(CMM) office is putting FDOC through the "risk reduction" process, e.g. verifying the information<br>security of the aggregated data, ensuring the tool complies with our technical and policy<br>objectives, making sure the information addresses the needs of the users, etc. User feedback<br>will help them refine FDOC's capabilities further. The tool will be provided in a series of<br>deliveries, and may also be integrated with other key programs, such as the Knowledge System<br>Prototype, Analyst Cockpit, and others.<br>(S//SI) Additional capability (Increment Four and Five) is scheduled for operational acceptance<br>testing on 18 August 2003. Watch for further developments!
