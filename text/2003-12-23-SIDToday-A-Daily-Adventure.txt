This is truly the place for people who want to<br>be involved in providing support to the warfighters and the decision makers. The CSG Joint Staff<br>is located in the National Military Joint Intelligence Center (NMJIC), in the heart of the Pentagon.<br>On 11 September 2001, when the rest of the Pentagon was evacuated, the NMJIC personnel<br>remained in place and continued working while another group from the CSG Joint Staff deployed<br>to a "secret, undisclosed location."<br>(U//FOUO) There is no shortage of surprises to be found in the Pentagon. Simply walking<br>through the hallways can be an adventure, seeing Chinese military officers, tourist groups, and<br>television news reporters. I once came upon Gen. Myers and Mr. Tenet talking in the hallway<br>with no minions or entourages in sight.<br>(S//SI) There are some unusual benefits for working in the Pentagon. Whenever we have to<br>brief someone, the "someone" is usually a general or admiral with decisionmaking authority and<br>responsibility. SIGINT is a most highly valued commodity here, and it quite often provides the<br>bulk of the information presented daily to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The CSG<br>watchstanders have an outstanding relationship with the other desks in the NMJIC and are relied<br>upon for a variety of intelligence expertise. The CSG plays a key role in the Pentagon's<br>"continuity of operations" plan.<br>(U//FOUO) An assignment to CSG Joint Staff, Pentagon, is truly a most satisfying job<br>experience. When our people go home from each shift, they know that they have contributed to<br>our national security.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are interested in pursuing job opportunities at the Pentagon, see the recent<br>announcement .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
