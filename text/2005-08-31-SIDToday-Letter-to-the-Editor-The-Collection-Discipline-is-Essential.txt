(U//FOUO) Here's a comment on the recent article Planning the Future of the Collection Skill
Community :
From:
(C//SI) The mere fact that we are finally realizing that "collecting signals" is an essential part of
the SIGINT process is refreshing. Collection, as a discipline, is much different today than ten
years ago. In another ten years, given the rapid growth of technology, it will be radically
different from today. BUT, somebody will still need to collect the signal, collection managers will
still need to help analysts weed through the maze of signals and communications paths available
to the target and data flow folks will still need to get the signal to the appropriate processor so
that it can be delivered to the analyst. While it is critical that the art of analysis be reborn, we
must also bring the collection and forwarding disciplines along with it.
