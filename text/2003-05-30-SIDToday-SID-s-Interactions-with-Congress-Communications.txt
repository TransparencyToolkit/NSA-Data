The busiest<br>months are typically March, April and May, because the staffers are<br>reviewing the CBJB and preparing their budget mark ups. This<br>year, a total of 18, 40, and 23 RFIs were received during these<br>months, respectively. A large majority of the queries require a very<br>quick turnaround during this time, and as it is LA's opportunity to<br>influence the mark ups, these requests are given focused<br>attention.<br>(U//FOUO) Requests for briefings tend to be heaviest from Jan May. Again, this is due to the fact that staffers are preparing for<br>their mark ups. This year, the number of staffer visits to SID<br>ranged from 12 to 16 per month during the period of March<br>through May. These visits often included multiple briefings.<br>(U) How Else Does SID LA Communicate With Congress?<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to budgeting issues, Congress is also<br>responsible for general oversight of NSA (and SID), to ensure we<br>are doing our job competently and adhering to the law. As a result,<br>we keep the Congress informed of significant developments that<br>may affect our performance (positively or negatively). A vehicle for<br>doing this is a "Congressional Notification". These range from "bad<br>news" reports-- such as power outages that have resulted in<br>degradation of service or security breaches at field stations-- to<br>items of interest such as:<br>the NSA Off-site Language Processing Facility;<br>Global Network Analyst Intern Program;<br>change in SID leadership; and<br>new partnerships with Third Parties.<br>As such, notifications are a great way to keep Congress informed of<br>good news as well as bad news. They should hear it from us before<br>they read it in the paper.<br>(U) How Does SID LA Communicate with the SID Workforce?<br>(U) Every Friday SID LA publishes a Weekly Congressional Update<br>providing feedback on recent congressional visits, highlighting<br>upcoming visits and congressional travel. This update can be found<br>on the SID LA website . The updates are also available via the SID<br>Notes/Reports section of the SID Today homepage.<br>(U) Organizational Structure<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID and Congress<br>1.

The office is not<br>forward-deployed from NSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SID<br>and staffed by SIGINTers. It is structured similarly to NSA LAO in<br>that SID LA has separate "account managers" for the involved<br>congressional committees. Office personnel usually attend SID<br>briefings to the congressional staffs and committees and provide<br>feedback on these sessions to SID leadership. They can then<br>provide background information as to the tone and context<br>surrounding follow-on queries from Congress.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on how NSA LAO interacts with<br>Congress, see their web page at "go lao".<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
