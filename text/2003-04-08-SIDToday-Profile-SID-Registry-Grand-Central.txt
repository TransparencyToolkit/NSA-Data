SID also<br>Support Operations<br>sends a lot of mail: notes to the Director, correspondence to other<br>(CSO)<br>directorates, correspondence to Congress, to name just a very few.<br>(U//FOUO) How to keep track of it all? Across the hall from the SID<br>Director's office you will find the SID Registry. Like a railroadswitching station (and equally atmospheric), Registry makes sure<br>that correspondence (called "packages") going into/out of SID is<br>handled efficiently. Does this package get the express treatment,<br>or the scenic route? Which track should it be sent down-should it<br>go to Data Acquisition, or maybe the SID Chief of Staff, or<br>someone else? Registry also monitors responses going out,<br>keeping a timetable to ensure a prompt reply. We also have<br>personnel integrated into SID/Customer Relationships, Analysis &amp;<br>Production and Data Acquisition to help keep the packages moving.<br>(U//FOUO) ...but there is more to the job than pulling levers.<br>Registry also tries to provide "value-added" service whenever<br>possible. We perform quality control, make sure Agency guidelines<br>are followed, and help offices format or edit correspondence, as<br>needed. Registry also generates correspondence on behalf of SID<br>(with guidance, of course, from senior management).<br><br>1.  Profiles: SID<br>Communications and<br>Support Operations<br>2.
