Co-located with the U.S. Army's bio-weapons research facility at Fort<br>Detrick, Maryland, AFMIC's primary mission is to prepare all-source medical intelligence, largely<br>in support of force health protection. The International Organizations Branch exploits and reports<br>the communications of non-governmental (NGO) and treaty monitoring organizations worldwide.<br>(TS//SI) What do AFMIC and the International Organizations Branch have in common? Quite a<br>lot. Several international NGOs regularly report outbreaks of infectious diseases; recent high<br>profile examples include SARS in China, cholera in Liberia, and dysentery, polio, and cholera in<br>Iraq - topics of great interest to AFMIC and by extension, the Intelligence Community.<br>Homegrown expertise and sufficient resources at NSA to process medical SIGINT are scarce<br>however, and as a result, unique and valuable medical intelligence - especially on lower<br>threshold topics - may go unreported.<br>(TS//SI) Once apprised in late 2002 of the limitations that prevent NSA from aggressively<br>reporting medical SIGINT, AFMIC quickly offered to detail a technical expert in epidemiology<br>part-time to help address this intelligence gap. At the same time, the Target Office of Primary<br>Interest (TOPI) worked closely with NSA's Office of Oversight and Compliance , the Office of<br>General Counsel , and others to address concerns about part-time integration. The AFMIC<br>analyst arrived in April 2003, took several NCS reporting courses and was ready for action by<br>early May. After being indoctrinated in USSID 18 and EO 12333, he was allowed access to<br>unminimized SIGINT data (or raw traffic) in select databases, and began authoring reports<br>almost immediately.<br>(TS//SI) The timing of the integree's arrival, as it coincided with a worldwide SARS epidemic,<br>could not have been better. While the quality of NSA reporting on SARS last spring was already<br>high, ready access to an in-house expert on infectious diseases who could effectively field<br>analysts' questions was tremendously beneficial. In addition, the partnership has generated<br>unique SIGINT reporting that supports the larger DoD and Intelligence Communities, an overall<br>refinement of the TOPI's efforts against complex public health targets, and a heightened<br>awareness among SID analysts of the value of medical SIGINT. Furthermore, his efforts to<br>develop related topics will inform and facilitate future endeavors to exploit medical intelligence in<br>the International Organizations Branch.<br>(U//FOUO) In today's high-volume and highly specialized SIGINT environment, NSA must<br>engage its partners to make maximum use of community analytic resources. Transformation 2.0<br>underscores the imperative to team with analytic experts across the community to ensure<br>responsive intelligence information for national decision-makers and military commanders. By<br>allowing customers with unique expertise to "swim upstream," and become active participants in<br>creating SIGINT products and services, NSA will have one more tool to effectively manage<br>today's information overload. In closing, we urge you to be on the lookout for similar<br>opportunities to engage your analytic counterparts in all aspects of collaboration and information<br>sharing. Follow your instincts and share your ideas with the experts at NSA. The pay-offs will be<br>tremendous.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
