Collection	of	GSM	links	regained	just	prior	to	start	of	military	operations	in	Fallujah	(TS//SI)
(TS//SI)	The	volume	of	collection	normally	seen	on	GSM	links	from	Fallujah	and	Northern
Baghdad	took	a	dramatic	drop	in	late	October	due	to	changes	in	the	cellular	network.	With	the
impending	Operation	Phantom	Fury	(the	US	military's	efforts	against	Fallujah)	the	lack	of
collection	from	these	links	was	a	severe	gap	in	intelligence	for	the	forces	on	the	ground.	Action
had	to	be	quick	and	decisive.
(TS//SI)	In	response	to	this	loss,	a	multi-organizational	team	was	formed	consisting	of
personnel	from	SCS,	CIA,	and	Office	of	Target	Reconnaissance	and	Survey	(OTRS)/MUSKETEER
with	the	requirement	to	locate,	identify,	and	exploit	the	lost	GSM	infrastructure	links.	A	QRC
microwave	survey	and	collection	system	was	deployed	to	Camp	Victory	(Baghdad)	to	reacquire
the	lost	links,	and	determine	a	suitable	position	to	relay	the	links	of	interest	to	the	SCS	Annex
(Koala	House)	for	processing	and	dissemination.	Within	a	two-week	period,	the	team
successfully	surveyed,	relayed,	and	restored	collection	of	the	lost	GSM	links.
(S//SI)	The	team	staged,	tested,	and	successfully	deployed	
	with
equipment	for	
	collection	within	seven	days	of	notification.	

(S//SI)	From	28	Oct	-	19	Nov,	the	team	surveyed	a	number	of	positions	
.
The	primary	area	of	focus	was	along	the	northern	perimeter	wall,	the	closest	proximity	to	
	links	for	Fallujah.	The
team	quickly	identified	all	signals	
	and	determined	
	potential
access	
	for	
	collection.
(TS//SI)	
	Because	Operation
Phantom	Fury	was	looming	on	the	horizon,	a	temporary	collection	strategy	to	collect	and	process
	the	
	link	was	employed	
	(annotated	"PANDA"	on	the	graphic).	A	relay	path	to	Koala	House,	
,	was	quickly	identified	and	established.	This	enabled
collected	Fallujah	GSM	communications	to	be	relayed	
	for	transcription	and
reporting.
(TS//SI)	With	the	temporary	solution	in	place	and	Phantom	Fury	in	full	swing,	the	team	set
about	constructing	the	collection	and	relay	point	for	the	entire	MSC	link.	However,	the	team
found	that	unforeseen	atmospherics	caused	significant	signal	degradation	making	it	impossible
to	collect	the	desired	MSC	links	from	one	location.	Thus	a	new	location	(annotated	"GRIZZLY"	on
the	graphic)	was	found	for	part	of	the	collection.	The	collection	from	GRIZZLY	coupled	with	the
collection	from	PANDA	covered	the	majority	of	the	MSC	links.	The	exceptional	crossorganizational	teaming	allowed	SIGINT	to	be	a	major	contributor	to	Operation	Phantom	Fury.
