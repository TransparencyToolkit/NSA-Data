(U) Drop and Give Me Five!
FROM: Wayne Murphy
SID CFC Keyworker
Run Date: 11/16/2005

"Hey, you there, drop and give me 5!!!"
Today across the Signals Intelligence Directorate everyone
is being asked to "drop and give 5" to the Combined
Federal Campaign -- 5 minutes of your time, that is. The
effect is almost as good for your heart as 5 push-ups. In a
year of record needs, SID is well on the way to record
giving. We don't want to lose the momentum as we
approach the holidays and the end of the campaign. Here's
your assignment:
1.  If you're unsure about giving and haven't visited the
online donation site to review your options I'm
asking that you take 5 minutes to do so today.
2.  If you've been planning to make a contribution, but just haven't found the time to do so - today's the day. Take 5 and make it happen.
3.  If you've already made your gift to the CFC -- thank you!, but please take that 5 minutes
to encourage a friend to be part of the campaign as well.
Here is your direct connection to helping others:

THANK YOU!!
