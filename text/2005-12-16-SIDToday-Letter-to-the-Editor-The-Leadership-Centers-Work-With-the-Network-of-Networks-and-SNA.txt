(U//FOUO) 
 of Organization Development Services (EL4) provided feedback on a
couple of recent articles. First, regarding the USSS Governance Video :
Comment: (U//FOUO) Greetings from the Leadership Center (ADET). I just watched the SID
Governance video (which was EXCELLENT) and I wanted to let you know that we in Organization
Development Services are completely in sync with Gen. Quirk's vision of a networked
organization. In fact, we have been engaged in initiatives over the past few years aimed at
understanding how to move the Agency from a hierarchy to a "network of networks." Needless
to say, it isn't easy! We are looking at ways of revealing and understanding the networks
through which work is being done...ways of "managing" self-organizing networks...technologies
that support collaboration...etc.
...And regarding the article (U) Using an Intelligence Analysis Technique -- On Ourselves :
Comment: (U//FOUO) A growing number of organizations in government and industry, including
NSA, are looking at using Social Network Analysis techniques to better understand the selforganizing social networks that are key to performance. Unlike the formal org chart, which
documents roles and responsibilities, social network maps show the pattern of relationships
through which work is actually done. The focus is on people rather than process, and
collaboration rather than tasking. 
's knowledge transfer pilot article presents one
perspective on this approach. Organization Development Services (go ODS), in the Leadership
Center, has been practicing using interview, SNA, and social action research techniques to
explore the link between social systems and performance for several years. Contact us if you're
interested in more information!
