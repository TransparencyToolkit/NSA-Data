(TS//SI) Austrian Partner Receives Time-Sensitive Report in Total
Team Effort
FROM:
Foreign Affairs Officer in Regional Targets (DP13/S2A)
Run Date: 12/23/2005

(S) Subtitled: The Three Stooges Engineer a Foreign Release Request
(TS//SI) What do you do when its nearing the end of the business day in Europe, on a Friday,
and you suddenly come across a TS//SI SIGINT report with the description of possible terrorist
carrying explosives traveling to a partner's country? And to make matters worse, SLO (Senior
Liaison Officer) Budapest/Vienna's email is not working and she's just told you she is packing up
for the day? Well, you call on your friends and colleagues to help you work the system as quickly
as possible!
(TS//SI) On the morning of 4 November, 
 FAO RT, found a report that indicated a
woman named "Inga" had boarded a bus in Bosnia and departed for Linz, Austria. Not only was
Inga possibly associated with terrorists, but she was also believed to be carrying explosives.
Even better, the report contained a complete description of darling Inga.
(TS//SI) Realizing that the Austrian partner needed to get this information as quickly as
possible, 
(who sits in the old Headquarters building) called over to DP1, where CDO
(Country Desk Officer) Croatia 
answered the phone. After learning of the situation,
he gamely agreed to call SLO
on the STU-III and tell her to not leave.
"ran" (ok, she wobbled as fast as her high heels would allow her to!) over to 2B only to be
greeted by
 with the information that SLO could listen on the STU, but could not talk
classified as the CIA Station was having a reception and full of uncleared people!!!
(TS//SI) As SLO had not been able to receive the report via e-mail, it was read to her over the
phone. She agreed the Austrians needed it and asked for the foreign release procedure to begin.
While
 was drafting a proposed sharable S//SI text, SLO managed to catch her Austrian
counterpart, 
 on his cell phone just as he was leaving for the day and told
him that something very important would be coming on his computer from us.
(TS//SI) 
, a branch manager in the Balkans Division, was cc'd on 
 email to the Foreign Release folks and approved the text with slight changes before the official
request from 
in CRD (Customer Relationships Directorate) arrived. Moments after
that, the slightly altered text -- both a COMINT and tearline section -- was passed across the
Baybridge circuit to the partner, who acknowledged receipt.
(TS//SI) This exceptional teaming by FAD (Foreign Affairs Directorate) and SID personnel, both
at headquarters and in the field, worked the entire release process in less than 45 minutes! We
are hoping to receive feedback from the Austrian partner when SLO visits with them this month.
