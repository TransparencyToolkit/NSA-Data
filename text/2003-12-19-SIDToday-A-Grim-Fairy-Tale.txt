DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) A 'Grim' Fairy Tale?<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/19/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) The following was forwarded to SIGINT Communications (anonymously) in response<br>to the recent Trade Jargon: Got Your "Ears"? article.<br>(U) This touches on one of my pet peeves about NSA writing. See the attached - Little Red<br>Riding Hood as reported by an NSA writer:<br>(U) In a previous time frame, there was a little girl who lived with her mother in the vicinity of<br>(IVO) the edge of the forest. Her grandmother, who loved her very much, had made her a red<br>cloak with a hood, and she wore it so often that everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood<br>(LRRH).<br>One day her mother (A) said to her "Your grandma is ill and all alone in her cottage in the<br>forest, and I want you to take her this basket comprising cakes. Make sure you don't talk to any<br>U/I personnel on the way.<br>LRRH (B) set off on the path, and she had not gone very far before she met a wolf.<br>"Good morning," said the wolf (C) "Where are you going in your beautiful red cloak?"<br>B: "Myself is taking this basket comprising cakes to my grandma, who is ill in bed."<br>C: "Where does your grandma live?"<br>B: "In the cottage IVO the end of the path."<br>Now, the wolf was very hungry, and he wanted to eat LRRH there and then. But he heard a<br>woodcutter working nearby, and did not like the atmospherics, so he ran off. The wolf went<br>ASAP through the forest to the grandmother's cottage and conducted knocking activities on her<br>door.<br>"Who's there?" Grandma (D) called.<br>C: "It's LRRH, and I've brought you a basket comprising cakes." (TR NOTE: The probable wolf<br>spoke in as girlish a voice as he could.)<br>D: "Then perform lifting activity on the latch and let yourself in!"<br>The wolf performed lifting activity vis-a-vis the latch and bounded in and swallowed her in one<br>gulp. Then he put on her shawl and nightcap and climbed in to her bed. Before long LRRH came<br>to the cottage and performed rat-tat-tat knocking activity on the door.<br>C: "Who's there?"<br>B: "It's myself, Grandma, and I've contributed to bringing you a basket comprising cakes."<br>C: "Then conduct lifting activity on the latch and let yourself in." (TR NOTE: The probable wolf<br>pulled the possible quilt up to his chin.) LRRH conducted lifting activity on the latch and walked<br>into the cottage.<br>B: "Why, Grandma, what big eyes you've got."<br>C: "All the better to conduct seeing activities re you, my dear."<br><br> </p>B: "And, Grandma, what big ears you've got."<br>C: "All the better to perform hearing on you, my dear."<br>B: "And, Grandma, what big teeth you've got."<br>C: "All the better to conduct eating activities!" (TR NOTE: A probable animal with a name similar<br>to that of a wolf possibly carried out jumping operations from the direction of the bed and ate<br>LRRH.)<br>Just then the woodcutter came by the cottage location and noticed that the door was in an open<br>status, so he looked in an inside direction. And when he saw the wolf conducting licking activites<br>with his chops, he performed ax cutting activity on the wolf's head. Then LRRH and her grandma<br>stepped out from inside the wolf, and after COB that day, LRRH never, ever held discussions<br>with U/I cadre again.<br>The moral of the story: How much would your kids goof on you if they knew how you wrote at<br>work?<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
