(U) Appointment of a New NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority
FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
Run Date: 10/05/2005

(U) The vision for Analysis & Production to be a global analytic enterprise has many key
components. One of the most critical elements is the responsibility to develop the analytic
workforce of the future. In order to deal with the volume, variety and velocity of data and the
complexity of the targets facing us today and in the future, we must ensure our analytic
workforce is provided with the right training, the right opportunities, the right tools, and the
right technology to succeed.
(U//FOUO) Because of the importance of this to the corporate Analysis and Production efforts,
Cindy Farkus has been appointed as the NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority as of 1 October
2005. She will continue to execute her responsibilities as Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis
and Production. Deborah Maklowski will serve as the Deputy Senior Intelligence Authority.
Cindy will work closely with Deborah and the SIA staff in overseeing the hiring, training, and
retention of the NSA/CSS Intelligence Analysis workforce.
(U//FOUO) This coincides with the creation of Associate Intelligence Authority (AIA) positions at
the Cryptologic Centers (CC) in Georgia, Colorado, Texas, and Hawaii. NSA/CSS Georgia
recently selected 
to be their AIA; NSA/CSS Hawaii's AIA position will be advertised in
October; and NSA/CSS Texas and Colorade will publish their AIA ads in the near future.
(U) Cindy, Deborah, and the SIA staff look forward to working together with all of you to ensure
that the NSA/CSS Intelligence Analysis Skill Community remains a committed, well-prepared,
and innovative force for cryptologic excellence. We value the engagement, thoughts, ideas, and
support of intelligence analysts everywhere and of our many partners and enablers in this
endeavor. You can reach Cindy via email at
