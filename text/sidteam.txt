(U//FOUO) On. the Road Again: SID Team Visits Germany

Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis & Production (S2)

Run Date: 02/01/2006

(U//FOUO) After staying around headquarters for the last quarter, it was time for
me to qet out and about into the extended enterprise! In early January I joined a
SID team on a trip to Germany to gain insight into the operations there and to

1 of 4

update the NSA/CSS Europe workforce on Agency, SID and S2 initiatives. Our team
consisted of:

SID Chief of Staff;

SID CoS Executive Assistant;

Deputy Technical Director;

DAP Executive Assistant; and
A/D DAP and Senior Intelligence Authority),

(U//FOUO) We visited elements of the European Command (EUCOM) headguarters
and NSA/CSS Europe (NCEUR) near Stuttgart, Germany; the European Security
Center (ESC) in Darmstadt; and the European Technical Cen
Wiesbaden, (See a map of NCEUR locations,! Chief, NCEUR,
accompanied us throughout.

Stuttgart: European. Command HQ and NSA/CSS Europe (U//FOUO)

(U//FOUO) We arrived in Stuttgart on Monday, 9 January, To stave off the jet lag,
we walked around downtown Stuttgart until meeting up with a group of NCEUR
folks for a dinner of good German food.

(C) On Tuesday morning we were treated to several briefings on EUCOM and
NCEUR^^^^^^and met with the EUCOM J3 (Director of Operations), Rear
Admiral^^^^pnd EUCOM J2 (Director of Intelligence), Brigadier General

coming away with a better understanding of their perspectives. We used the
opportunity to explain to them how NSA's distributed analytic enterprise can be
engaged in efforts to meet their information needs.

(U//FOUO) Our session with the J3 was very positive and he appreciated the value
of analysis. Rear Admiral	feels strongly that intelligence sharing needs a

systematic approach to enable transparency. He recognizes that we are integrated
and connected and therefore can't afford to operate independently,

(U//FOUO) We next met with the J2, BG ^^^|The JAC (EUCOM's Joint Analysis
Center in Molesworth, England) joined us virtually, giving us the chance to hear
their concerns. We discussed the Mission Build-out, governance, resource
challenges and mission management of a distributed enterprise, A key area of
concern is “less commonly taught languages" and what we're doing to meet that
challenge. We made sure they knew that A&P is at the forefront by leveraging
language resources in Utah (see a related message), the National Virtual
Translation Center (NVTC), and our 2nd party partners. We intend to leverage
those opportunities enterprise-wide. We also discussed the new “lane structure"
and the Strategic Mission List, BG	interested in results from an all-source

perspective and asked that we keep our capabilities relevant to EUCOM, He was
glad we were there and hoped we would gain an appreciation of their ops during
the rest of our visit.

(U//FOUO) We also held a town meeting with NCEUR personnel to cover current
events relating to resources and the structure of the Agency, as well as strategic
planning initiatives. Major points included;

*	Future trends and challenges in A & P

*	Future roles for the extended enterprise in A & P

2 of 4

*	Changes in IT infrastructure due to new tools and techniques

*	S2 Assessment Cell

*	Senior Intelligence Authority issues

(U//FOUO) We need to ensure we take advantage of their forward presence. As a
forward-deployed function they are empowered leaders and strategists. We need to
keep doing forward what's best done forward! Following a busy and productive day
we went to a great little restaurant11 Waldheim'1 - or "home in the woods,"

(U//FOUO) Patch BaiTacks, near Stuttgart: home to EUCOM HQ and NCEUR.
Darmstadt; The European Security Center (U//FOUO)

(U//FOUO) On the morning of Wednesday 11 January, we traveled to Darmstadt

visit with the 66th MI Group	Center, CO^^^^

MI GP	LTC	Directorial

ESC Deputy Director; and their energetic team provided an outstanding
overview of their organizational structure, operations, successes and challenges,

(U//FOUO) The ESC** is a functioning part of the enterprise. They've made great
strides in their analytic expertise, The analytic support received from SID/S2/SSG
is great and continues to expand, S2 elements, in particular GEO, CT, RT, and CP,
were lauded for their outstanding support. The ESC, as an A&P-forward function
gives them many advantages, Their state-of-the-art operations area allows them
quick, deployable, and operational partnerships. Weekly VTCs with virtual teams
for targets relevant to the EUCOM theater help them maintain perspective,

Wiesbaden: The European Technical Center (U//FOUO)

(U//FOUO) We drove on to Wiesbaden that evening. We met up with folks from the
ETC for dinner (at a great restaurant - The Winkger (yes, the Vikinger)) to get to
know a bit about each other and to help set the stage for Thursday's visit. Through
a series of briefings we gained a good perspective on the critical role ETC plays in
the enterprise and gained an appreciation of how we can work together to benefit
the enterprise. We also held a town meeting with the ETC team where I reiterated
what a great job they are doing with customers, partners, and Third Party
relationships.

Impressions (U)

(U//FOUO) Throughout the visit, the knowledge and insights our personnel gain by
being "forward" in the customer's domain was evident. Even more impressive was
how their knowledge of other operations centers, such as NSA HQ, the Cryptologic
Centers, SCS, mission ground stations - just to name a few - was being leveraged to
respond to the needs of the EUCOM customer. By knowing how the cryptologic
system operates, and knowing howto insert requirements, our personnel are able
to make significant contributions to the cryptologic enterprise. In addition, they
grow professionally and personally - by seeing our Agency from a different
perspective, gaining a broader understanding of how we're viewed, and by
experiencing life in a different culture,
