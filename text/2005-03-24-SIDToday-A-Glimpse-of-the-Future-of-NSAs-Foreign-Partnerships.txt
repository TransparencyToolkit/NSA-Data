(S) On 11 February, Gary Grantham, Principal Director for Foreign Affairs, briefed the National
SIGINT Committee on NSA's Foreign Affairs Program. Gary gave the members of the Committee
a "glimpse of the future," focusing on some upcoming initiatives with our foreign partners. Gary
talked about foreign partners in general, pointing out that NSA foreign relationships don't just
benefit NSA/CSS, but the US Defense and Intelligence Communities as well. The contributions of
our partners were also highlighted, from support to our efforts against global terrorism,
weapons proliferation, and regional conflicts, to information sharing for strategic warning, treaty
monitoring, and technology transfer.
(TS//SI) Future happenings:
Gary mentioned that the Foreign Affairs Directorate was already preparing for the 2006
Winter Olympics that will be held in Turin, Italy. The support given to the Greeks for the
2004 Summer Olympics provides a successful model to be shared with the Italians.
The multinational collaboration in the Pacific (also known as SIGINT Seniors Pacific) is
another effort in which FAD has been fully engaged, working closely with the SIGINT
Directorate, the Counterterrorism Product Line, and NSA/CSS field representatives. April
will see the first meeting of the new Pacific multinational forum for SIGINT collaboration;
the intent is to begin the trust-building process, establish a common understanding of
the purposes of the group, discuss a proposed organizational construct and concept of
operations, and establish an Executive Board.
Gary touched on the NSA relationships with Ethiopia and Pakistan, stressing that both will
continue to be key in our successes in the global war on terrorism.
Gary also discussed FAD's previous and future work with the Iraqis and Afghans. While
neither relationship is a formally established NSA partnership, at the direction of the
Director of Central Intelligence, FAD has moved aggressively to help these countries
establish and enhance their SIGINT capabilities. Both relationships come with risks, but
the overall benefit to US objectives in the region outweighs the risks.
(U//FOUO) Gary's "glimpse of the future" brief was well received by the SIGINT Committee
members. The National SIGINT Committee is located in Washington, on L Street NW. The
permanent members are from the Intelligence Community, specifically State, Treasury, Energy,
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, CIA, DIA, FBI, NRO, Coast Guard, NGA, DHS, and NSA.
The National SIGINT Committee assists the DCI and DIRNSA on a wide range of SIGINT matters.
The Committee provides an independent forum for those with SIGINT equities to meet and
exchange information, to discuss policy and other issues, to build consensus, and to provide
well-reasoned recommendations to the DIRNSA and the DCI.
