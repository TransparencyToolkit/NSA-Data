(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce
another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe
these sessions are of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are
interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(U//FOUO) This month's featured speaker is 

 from SSG/Operation Orchestration.

Presentation summary :
(U//FOUO) RHINEHART is a project that addresses a significant challenge facing the SIGINT
community: how to effectively isolate voice communications of interest from vast amounts of
collection. RHINEHART is an exploration and prototyping effort that introduces commercial- and
government-developed automated voice selection and filtering solutions into an operational
SIGINT environment. The goal is to decrease the amount of time a language analyst spends
listening to traffic and increase time spent on evaluating and reporting traffic of intelligence
value.
(U//FOUO) This brown bag session will discuss RHINEHART prototype capabilities, initial testing
results and feedback, and where the effort is headed this year. In addition, a live web-enabled
demonstration of the capability will be provided at the end of the session. Please join us as
SIGDEV explores ways to narrow the linguist resource gap that face NSA and the intelligence
community.
