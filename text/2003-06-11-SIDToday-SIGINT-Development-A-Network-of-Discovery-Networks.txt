An iterative process, it is an element of all of our jobs, which underpins the<br>maintenance of our technical health, responsiveness, and ensures the continuing success of the<br>SIGINT system.<br>(U//FOUO) Organizationally, SIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG) provides strategic<br>direction and oversight of SIGDEV initiatives and activities throughout the enterprise, while the<br>three centers -- Target Analysis Center (TAC), Network Analysis Center (NAC), and Target<br>Technology Trends Center (TTTC) -- develop tools and techniques and trends information that<br>enable SID to know and own the target and its communications.<br>(U//FOUO) The SIGDEV mission extends well beyond the corporate elements. If the SIGINT<br>Directorate's SIGINT authorities govern your work role, then SIGDEV is probably an element of<br>your job, and you are part of this growing network of discovery networks. To be successful,<br>SIGDEV leverages the skills, talents and expertise of the individual people, and capitalizes on<br>the capabilities of our international SIGDEV partners as well as industry and academia. The<br>SIGDEV community is transforming SIGINT by teaming to forge new alliances across the<br>corporation, the nation and the world to meet the challenges of understanding and exploiting<br>today's complex networks and to more fully serve our national security mission.<br>(S//SI) In the past few months alone, the SIGDEV community has worked together to:<br>Stand up the Iraq Terrorism Development Center - a collaborative partnership that<br>includes the Office of Counterterrorism (CT), Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO), Office<br>of Middle East North Africa (MENA), the Collection Requirements and Strategies Center<br>(CSRC), the Meade Operations Center (MOC), and the Army Technical Control and<br>Analysis Element (ATCAE), and which draws on expertise throughout the SIGDEV<br>Community. The ITDC develops leads on terrorists and former regime targets in Iraq with<br>a goal of helping NSA/CSS increase intelligence production against these targets and to<br>assist CENTCOM in its operational planning.<br>Assume operational responsibility for the activities of the Meade Operations Center<br>(MOC).<br>Accept a significant role in filling gaps identified this fall at the SIGINT Site Commanders<br>Operational Review .<br>Sponsor a High-Powered Cordless Phone conference in October that attracted nearly 500<br>participants from around the world.<br>Expand the remit of the Joint International Topics Cell (JINTAC) from a bilateral<br>agreement supporting counter terrorism, to a Five Eyes collaborative effort covering<br>additional transnational problems: counterproliferation and international crime and<br>narcotics.<br>Develop three new Communities of Practice: SIGINT Reporting, Complex Systems<br>Analysis, and Filtering and Selection on the SIGDEV Learning Portal expanding 24/7<br>access to authoritative information on SIGDEV policies, tools, techniques and evolving<br>technologies.<br><br> </p>(U//FOUO) Watch this space in the coming weeks for more details on these and more activities<br>and initiatives taking place throughout the SIGDEV community, including the upcoming SIGDEV<br>Conference, 21-25 June 2004.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information, see the SIGDEV homepage ("go sigdev") .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
