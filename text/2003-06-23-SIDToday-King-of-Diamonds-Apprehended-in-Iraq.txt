When the summary of<br>contacts was delivered to the Army, officials requested that CENTCOM issue a final authorization<br>to seize Al-Numan. CIHS followed the tip-off with a limited distribution report the next morning.<br>Within 25 hours of the initial contact by the Army, Aziz Salih Al-Numan was apprehended, and<br>Army sources phoned in their appreciation for CIHS's quick response to their request for timesensitive support.<br>(U) According to press reports, Al-Numan ordered the destruction of Shi'a holy sites while<br>Governor of Karbala' and of An Najaf from 1977-1986.
