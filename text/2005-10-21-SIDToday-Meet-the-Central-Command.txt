(U) CENTCOM occupying center stage in military operations...
(S//SI) Turn on the evening news, and you are likely to see a
substantial amount devoted to issues related to the United States
Central Command's (CENTCOM) mission. That level of national
interest is also clearly reflected in the resources and energy the
SIGINT system devotes to CENTCOM targets, which include Iraq,
Afghanistan, and Iran. This is the first in a series of SID today
articles on the SIGINT relationship between NSA/CSS worldwide
and CENTCOM.
(U) Introduction to CENTCOM
(S//REL) CENTCOM, located in Tampa, Florida, was established in
January 1983 as the successor to the Rapid Deployment Joint Task
Force. As its name implies, CENTCOM covers the "central" area of
the globe located between the European and Pacific Commands.
See CENTCOM's Area of Responsibility .
(S//REL) Army General John P. Abizaid (pictured), Commander of
CENTCOM, focuses CENTCOM and the Intelligence Community with
his quarterly Top Ten mission list - here is the latest one:
1.  Defeat al-Qaida and associated movements.
2.  Stabilize Iraq and Afghanistan to sustain political progress
and promote self-reliance.
3.  Build and mentor loyal, well trained, sustainable partner
security forces capable of taking the lead in the fight
against extremists.
4.  Sustain the flow of strategic resources by protecting key
infrastructure and lines of communication.
5.  Deter Iran and Syria.
6.  Protect the force against asymmetric threats, with priority
against improvised explosive devices and suicide bombers.
7.  Reshape our strategic posture in the AOR for the Long War:
smaller, more expeditionary US forces, enabling others to
help themselves.
8.  Seize the strategic communications initiative - amplify
moderate voices and de-legitimize extremist leaders.
9.  Develop war-fighting networks to optimize joint, coalition
and inter-agency capabilities.
10.  Prevent proliferation of WMD/E throughout the region.
(U) NSA/CSS SIGINT Support to CENTCOM
(TS//SI) The NSA/CSS relationship with CENTCOM is
"excellent," according to GEN Abizaid. CENTCOM views NSA as a
critical operational partner, due to our relentless application of
transformational activities, such as expeditionary SIGINT, for
CENTCOM. Through a strong physical, integrated, presence with

3.  CENTCOM's 'Long
War'

 CENTCOM both in Tampa and in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Qatar
(CENTCOM's Headquarters in the field), and other locations,
NSA/CSS has a National Cryptologic Representative
(NCR)/Cryptologic Support Group (CSG)/Combat Support Team
(CST) contingent of about 180 personnel overseas, and 40
personnel in Tampa who provide direct, face-to-face customer
support. In addition, there are 95 Special Collection Service (SCS)
people in theater. We have created four NCR positions (more than
for any other customer), with accompanying CSGs, to ensure NSA
understands CENTCOM's intelligence needs and that we deliver
actionable SIGINT to them.
(S//SI) There is a much larger team of U.S., 2nd and 3rd Party
people at NSA/CSS-Washington, NSA/CSS-Georgia, and around
the world, collecting, processing, analyzing, and producing that
valuable SIGINT. It is no exaggeration to state that SIGINT daily
directs when and where CENTCOM engages the terrorists
and other enemies. In fact, NSA/CSS is part of the CENTCOM
operational action team, with our people on the phone, internet
and sometimes in person with them as they defeat the terrorists.
