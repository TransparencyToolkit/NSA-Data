Getting what you need to know from the SID Mailbag (U)
(U) The SID Mailbag is the easiest, most efficient and reliable method to get the answers to your
seemingly unanswerable questions. Or to the questions to which you have gotten six different
answers. With SID Mailbag, you will get the answers from the people who actually know. Get the
correct answers, not RUMINT or hearsay or what you heard from somebody who heard it from
somebody else.
(U) The process goes like this: you write in a question to the SID Mailbag, accessing it from the
lower corner of the SID Today page under "Workforce Outreach"/SID Mailbag/Submit
Comments. SIGINT Communications will forward the question to the appropriate individual who
can answer the question with authority. The turnaround time from question to answer is usually
kept to one week, but some responses may take longer to track down.
(U) Answers are posted in the SID Mailbag, and the SID today page will reflect that the Mailbag
has been updated with new information. Keep in mind that you have the option of submitting
your questions anonymously, if you prefer -- simply omit your name and e-mail address. (But
note that this anonymity feature makes it impossible for SIGINT Communications or the
responder to ask you for clarification or details.)
(U) Keep in mind, too, that questions addressed to the SID Mailbag should pertain to SIGINT or
to SID. While there are many other things that are of interest to the SID workforce, unless they
are within SID's scope, the Mailbag will not be able to respond. On the Mailbag page, however,
there is a list of contacts for questions that might relate to enabling organizations throughout
the Agency. They would be in a better position to answer non-SID questions.
(U) So, next time you are wondering about a process, a procedure, a plan or a policy, get the
"real deal" answers with SID Mailbag.
