(U//FOUO) During World War II the site on which the European Technical Center
(ETC) is located (in Mainz Kastel, Germany) served as a tank repair depot. Not too
surprisingly, the station was a key target of Allied bombing. On December 20, 2005,
during survey activities of the area for installation of an underground fiber optic
line, metallic anomalies were discovered and these were suspected of being
unexploded ordnance, since such items had been discovered previously,

(U//FOUO) Operating with the following guiding principles, ETC and NSAW
personnel began contingency planning to ensure that critical ETC functions would
continue in the event of an explosion,

*	To protect human life,

*	To protect business eguities in a prudent manner,

*	To keep as much of the business running as possible, and

*	To put in place contingency measures for personnel, cryptologic equipment,
and communication links,

(U//FOUO) By 12 January 2006, it had been determined that the risk of an
uncontrolled explosion was low and that the distance from the closest anomaly to
ETC buildings was outside the restricted zone as required by German law.

However, to ensure safety, the entire base was to be closed to all personnel on
24 and 25 January. Based on briefings provided by ETC to the Provost Marshall,
ETC was permitted to man the Network Communication Center with two critical
staff members,

(S//SI) ETC and NSAW personnel worked to mitigate the risk by setting up an
alternate communications facility at Mainz Finthen, Unfortunately only six of the
circuits passing through ETC from the Top 100 Circuits list could be accommodated
by the alternate link and none of those was a foreign partner link, (All were directly
supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan,) A message was sent to the appropriate
SLOs (SIGINT Liaison Officers) to notify the partners of the potential impact, but
also to assure them that the chance of disruption was small,

(C) Excavation was initiated on 24 January, The four anomalies were dug up and no
ordnance was found. Three of the four holes contained miscellaneous metallic
debris and the fourth contained I-beams that supported an underground storage
area or tunnel in the original WW3I facility. The base was to be reopened for normal
traffic at 1800 local time and normal ETC operations were resumed on 25
January.
