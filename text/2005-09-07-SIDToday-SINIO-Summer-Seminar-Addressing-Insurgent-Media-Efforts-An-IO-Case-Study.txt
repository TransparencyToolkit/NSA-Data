Course Overview:
(TS) While bullets are flying between U.S./Coalition forces and local insurgents on the ground in
Iraq and Afghanistan, a different type of war is taking place in the cyber world. Anit-US, jihadist
groups have established Internet websites containing inflamatory rhetoric or public information
that is potentially dangerous to the U.S. homeland and its interests around the world. The
jihadist websites have cleverly leveraged Internet technology to produce a powerful IO campaign
intended to counter U.S. initiatives in Iraq and other parts of the Muslim world. This seminar will
explore a number of issues and challenges facing the U.S. military commands (CENTCOM and
Special Operations Command) as they organize and coordinate an effort to counter the contents
posted on the jihadists websites by applying selected IO techniques against all aspects of the
website targets, including the contents, the users, the website owners, and even the Internet
Service Providers hosting the websites. Particular attention will be paid to NSA's ability to
support, and participate in, specific types of IO capabilities proposed against the websites.
(U//FOUO) This seminar will be held at the TS//SCI//NF classification level.
(U//FOUO) Please consult the SINIO Website ("go sinio") for information on future events in this
