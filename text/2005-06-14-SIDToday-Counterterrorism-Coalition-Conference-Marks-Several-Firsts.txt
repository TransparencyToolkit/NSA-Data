(S) Counterterrorism Coalition Conference Marks Several Firsts
FROM: 
FAD's Special Advisor to CT for Foreign Partner Strategies (DP1)
Run Date: 06/14/2005

(S//SI) The semi-annual SIGINT Seniors Counterterrorism Coalition (SISECT) conference held
recently in Canada was by all measures a huge success, marked by several firsts:
first participation by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD),
first meeting of the Counterterrorism (CT) Deputies (a management-level forum
commissioned by the Seniors in June 04 to identify ways to optimize the multilateral
sharing of lead information),
first open discussion of C2C (computer to computer) issues.
(TS//SI) CT analysts from the twelve participating nations (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the US) presented formal
briefings, ranging from applying the NATO I&W (Indications & Warning) system to the CT
problem, to follow the money and CBRN topics, to terrorist-related maritime operations, to Iraq,
to Sunni activity in Europe. Highlights were a Dutch brief on a self-radicalized 17-year-old they
had recently arrested (which illustrated all too well how some are able very successfully to elude
coming up on anyone's radar) and the Danish and Swedish briefs on extremists active in their
own backyards.
(TS//SI) The analytic group discussion topics included changing terrorist modus operandi, the
Iraqi Jihadist Highways Project/Syrian facilitation networks, north African extremist networks in
Europe, and Ansar al-Islam (AI) in Europe. Inter alia, the nations:
validated the exchange of telephony metadata to support traffic analysis and call chaining
efforts;
began work on standardizing formats to facilitate the exchange of call chaining diagrams
via SIGDASYS ;
began a discussion of language issues;
agreed to continue collaboration on the Jihadist Highways Project;
agreed in principle to participating in additional collaboration topics (agreeing to share
priority projects/focus areas and agreeing to a second joint project, this one on AI in
Europe );
agreed to the CT Deputies' stated need for documenting measures of success related to
sharing within SISECT; and
agreed to prime their respective Seniors on the legal/policy issues related to the sharing
of C2C information.
The nations were unanimous in their characterization of SISECT as having become a true
community, with ever-increasing levels of trust and openness -- and the enthusiasm was
infectious.
