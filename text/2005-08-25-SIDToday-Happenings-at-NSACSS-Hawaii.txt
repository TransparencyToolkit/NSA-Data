(U) Happenings at NSA/CSS Hawaii
FROM: Colonel Mark Westergren, USAF
Director, NSA/CSS Hawaii Signals Intelligence Directorate (HSID)
Run Date: 08/25/2005

(U//FOUO) SID today presents its first periodic update from NSA/CSS Hawaii in Kunia. This is
part of a running series of operational updates from the SID Deputy Directorates and the
Cryptologic Centers (former RSOCs).
(U) Senior Leadership Activities
(U//FOUO) The HSID staff welcomes the two most recent arrivals to its key leadership: Colonel
Mark Westergren, USAF as the Signals Intelligence Director and Ms. Sally Holcomb as the
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director at NSA/CSS Hawaii.
(U//FOUO) Colonel Westergren joins us having just completed a year as an Air Force Fellow to
the Rand Corporation. He brings over 20 years of experience with a background in physics,
weapons systems and intelligence operations.
(U//FOUO) Ms. Sally Holcomb, NSA/DISES joins the HSID from NSAW where she served in the
Office of the Director as a National Security Agency/Central Security Service Director's Executive
Assistant. Ms. Holcomb brings over 18 years of experience with a background in Asian language,
policy and security including a previous tour at Kunia as the Director of Security (J2).
(U) Operations
(U//FOUO) Hawaii Build-Out
(S//SI) The mission realignment and build out continues. As the Kunia Regional Security
Operations Center (KRSOC) became National Security Agency Central Security Service
(NSA/CSS), Hawaii, the KRSOC Operations Directorate (J3) became the Hawaii Signals
Intelligence Directorate (HSID) . This transformation represents more than a simple redesignation of specific offices. It is an intentional alignment of form and function corresponding,
as directly as possible, to the enterprise-wide mission and resource management structure. This
restructuring occurs in concert with a largely identical process at NSA/CSS Texas and Georgia.
The newly restructured HSID is patterned after NSA Washington and is comprised of five key
organizations:
HS/S0 SID Staff - Leadership and directorate-level staff functions
HS1 - Customer Gateway, Customer Relations, Warfighter Support
HS2 - Analysis and Production, reporting and Product Line support
HS3 - Access and Collection, Processing and Exploitation, Collection Management and
Computer Network Exploitation
HSSG - SIGDEV Strategy & Governance, SIGDEV, Target Development
