Click<br>HERE to see part one.<br>(U) Post 9/11 Surge<br>(S//SI) Following 9/11, the need for more linguists with native or near-native ability in lowdensity languages was critical and once again, we turned to the off-site facility concept. The first<br>post 9/11 mission that was established was for Somali. In order to establish it quickly, and<br>because one of the most talented linguists could be cleared only to SECRET, the mission was set<br>up at the SECRET level. Since this involved taking SIGINT out of SCI channels, the Director had<br>to approve the mission. An Urdu mission at the S//SI level quickly followed.<br>(S//SI) "Rodehouse" - as the project was now called - was short on space at Airport Square, just<br>as more language missions were urgently needed to support Counterterrorism efforts. In<br>response, NSA leased and outfitted the third floor of <br>, and the project moved into the<br>new facility in February 2003. With room to expand, four more missions were added: Arabic,<br>Amheric, Pasto/Dari and Tagalog. All of these missions are at the S//SI level, and we plan to<br>establish additional SECRET missions only by exception.<br>(U) Clearance Issues<br>(S//SI) Although the S//SI missions do not require the Director's approval, each is documented<br>by an SPF (Staff Processing Form) signed by the SID Deputy for Communication and Support<br>Operations, to ensure that it is in accordance with SID policy. The specific requirements and<br>operations of each mission are also documented in a CONOP (Concept of Operations), which is<br>reviewed by the target offices, the Directorate for Data Acquisition and the contractor. The<br>linguists are supervised by fully-cleared contractors who also provide liaison with the target<br>offices. Because the facility has personnel at three clearance levels (SECRET, S//SI and TS//SI),<br>they are physically segregated and have different levels of computer access. Working with the<br>ITIS organization and DK (the Chief Information Officer), a multi-level systems security<br>architecture was developed for Rodehouse. In addition, the linguists were given the first<br>operational deployment of the latest suite of transcription tools, named Nucleon.<br>(U) Future Opportunities<br>(U) Rodehouse offers many opportunities for employing government and contractor personnel<br>who are not fully cleared. A pilot Russian OJT (On-the Job Training) program for first term<br>military linguists who do not yet have their full clearance is underway and, if successful, could be<br>a model other language OJT programs. There is also the possibility of bringing government<br>personnel who do not yet have their full clearance into the facility.<br>(U) The RSOC's and Second Party Partners have both expressed interested in establishing<br>Rodehouse-type facilities, and we are working with them on the many complex security,<br>systems and personnel issues that must be addressed for this approach to be successful.<br>(U) In an environment that requires a flexible, rapid response to changing world events,<br>Rodehouse provides another language resource to target offices.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
