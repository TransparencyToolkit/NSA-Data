(S//SI) Can 'Motor City' Manufacture Some Arabic Language
Assistance for NSA?
FROM: Cindy Farkus
Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis & Production (S2)
Run Date: 12/15/2005

(S//SI) NSA is seeking Arabic linguists wherever they reside in the U.S. We've made a good
start, but there's far to go.
(S//SI) Have you heard of the Detroit Global Language Center (DGLC)? It is located on Selfridge
Army National Guard Base. This facility contains an NSA Reserve Mission Management secure
enclave and Joint Reserve Intel Center (JRIC) SCIF**, which after the completion of renovations
can accommodate a classified language processing operation with PL3** connectivity. Why
should this mean anything to us here at NSAW? Let me explain.
(S//SI) Many of us are aware that NSA/CSS's ability to attract and hire Arabic language analyst
applicants capable of beginning operational work continues to be a challenge. The Office of
Recruitment and Staffing (MB) has focused its recruitment efforts on increasing the number of
fully qualified Arabic language analysts hired and decreasing the need for language
enhancement courses. While FY04 saw 30 direct placements into operations and 31 in FY05 the
Arabic Senior Language Authority (SLA) reports that overall, the number of hired minimum level
2/2 Arabic linguists has declined by 41% since 2002. Although the number of applicants has
increased, the quality of hires has decreased.
(S//SI) Because the Detroit area currently has the largest Arabic-speaking population in the
United States, this past September representatives from the Office of Recruitment and Staffing
(MB), NSA/CSS Georgia and the Senior Language Authority conducted a career invitational to
attract potential Arabic linguist hires in Detroit for placement at the Detroit Global Language
Center (DGLC.) Over 750 resumes were submitted. Following preliminary processing, 145
applicants were invited to take two placement exams. Forty-three applicants passed both tests,
with an additional 10 passing one (those who passed one exam are being invited to retest on the
2nd exam).
(S//SI) The Associate Directorate for Security and Counterintelligence (Q2) is processing the
candidates in the priority order provided by the SLA/Arabic, however, initial special source
checks on the top 47 applicants have unearthed considerable issues. As a result of those checks,
eight applicants have been removed from consideration and a number will require significant and
lengthy investigation that may not sufficiently resolve the identified issues.
(S//SI) Currently, the JRIC Detroit SCIF, located on the second floor of the Naval Reserve
Center on Selfridge, is undergoing Phase II renovations and is scheduled for completion by
January 2006. Once complete, the SCIF's layout will meet minimum requirements for housing
three separate groups of linguists:
a central compartment with 10 TS//SI workstations are already in place,
an outer compartment, accredited to TS/SI/TK/H/G, will accommodate 5 S//SI
workstations and,
an additional 5 SECRET-level workstations will be operational within the NRC's secure
enclave on the 1st floor.
This configuration, incorporating a 4-shift schedule, can accommodate up to 85 linguists, with 15
mission managers in support, bringing the total to 100 personnel. The DGLC SCIF will be
equiped with NSANet connectivity and HIGHCASTLE voice processing/analysis & reporting
systems. When we identify the right people we will have a place for them to work.
(S//SI) While the career invitational was successful in identifying a large talent pool of potential

 applicants, the Detroit initiative may not yield many hires. We will continue to review other sites
to help satisfy this requirement. With continued cooperation among NSA/CSS's enablers and
mission organizations including Eagle Alliance, Installations & Logistics, Reseve Mission
Management, and the Senior Language Authority we are sure to meet with success.
