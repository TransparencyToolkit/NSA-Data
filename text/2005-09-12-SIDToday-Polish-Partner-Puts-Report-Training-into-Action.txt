(S//SI) Polish Partner Puts Report Training into Action
FROM:
Foreign Affairs Officer for SID/Regional Targets (DP13/S2A)
Run Date: 09/12/2005

(S//SI) Our Polish counterparts quickly master SIGINT report-writing skills.
(S//SI) SIGINT analysts from the Polish Intelligence Agency's Coordinating and Processing
Center (CPC) in Warsaw made quick use of the basic report-writing class given by FAD (Foreign
Affairs Directorate) personnel in July. Eleven students attended the class, including intercept
operators, transcribers, analyst/reporters, and CPC managers. They learned how to organize a
report, put the bottom line up front (BLUF) and to lead with a meaningful summary so as to
better serve their (and our) customers. Additional time was also spent on what was reportable
on each of the Polish targets and then students composed reports in small groups.
(S//SI) Students were very enthusiastic about the training and were quick to grasp the ideas
presented in the class. In fact, on the Monday following the course, the CPC analysts submitted
two reports to NSA! Both reports were well received by the TOPIs* at NSAW and NSA/CSS Texas
and were turned around the same day with only minor edits.
(S//SI) Several offices, including CIHS (Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support) and the Office
of Russia, had asked the instructor to provide feedback on the value of the CPC's intercept, and
both students and management were appreciative to learn their work was being used. After
learning that Russian Border Guards were of interest to NSA, one of the CPC managers
immediately directed her senior analyst to produce a baseline report and follow it up with any
other reportable information.
(S//SI) This course comes at a vital time in the Polish relationship as CPC analysts prepare to fly
solo when FAD's two TLOs (Technical Liaison Officers) return to NSA. Overall, CPC personnel
seemed eager to engage in meaningful work and grateful to receive both the feedback and the
training. They requested additional reporter training in the hopes of improving even more. While
more advanced training will be taught in late 2005, our Polish partner seems ready, willing, and
able to take on the challenge facing them in the coming months!
