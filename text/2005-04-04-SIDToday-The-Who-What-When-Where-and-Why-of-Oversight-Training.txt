(U) The Who, What, When, Where and Why of Oversight Training
FROM:
SID Senior Oversight Executive
Run Date: 04/04/2005

(U//FOUO) Another year has gone by and it's time to ensure you've met the annual Intelligence
Oversight (I/O) training requirement for FY05. We have done our best to help you meet this
requirement in a convenient and efficient way, via an NSANet webpage. Some of you have
already completed the training for this year, while others are hearing about it for the first time.
To find out more about the I/O training requirement or to refresh your memory, the 5 W's are
included below:
WHAT: (U//FOUO) The basic I/O training requirement is to read annually the legal documents
that govern our mission in SID. There are now five documents that you are asked to review:
Executive Order 12333,
USSID 18,
NSCID 6,
DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and
NSA Policy 1-23.
The first three are the core documents covering NSA's legal authorities and restrictions and the
definition of SIGINT. The latter two implement the Executive Order within DoD and NSA, so it's
important to be familiar with them as DoD/NSA employees.
WHY: (U//FOUO) The basic principle behind these documents is the right to privacy. Since the
SID mission involves electronic surveillance, it is subject to strict control under the U.S.
Constitution, federal law, and Executive Branch regulations designed to protect the fundamental
privacy rights of U.S. persons. Familiarity with the above documents is therefore an important
responsibility of every SID employee.
WHO: (U//FOUO) The requirement applies to ALL SID EMPLOYEES , including civilians,
military, contractors and integrees. In general, if your organizational designator begins with "S,"
you should be using this process. However, it is not meant to supplant other systems in use by
external elements. Most field sites, for example, already have similar web-based systems that
employees at those locations should continue to use.
WHERE: (U//FOUO) The documents can be accessed via the NSA web at the SID I/O training
webpage . If this is the first time you have logged into the system, you'll be asked to register
and obtain a password. In subsequent visits to the site, you will simply enter your user ID along
with that password. You are not expected to read all the documents at once. While the system
cannot bookmark your place in each document, it will keep track of each document you have
completed.
WHEN: (U) You may log on to the system at any time to begin. You are asked to have your
reading completed by the end of fiscal year, i.e., by 30 September 2005.
(U//FOUO) Thank you for your cooperation in using this process and completing the required
reading by the end of the fiscal year.
