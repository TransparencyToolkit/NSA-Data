(U//FOUO) It comes as no surprise that the SIGINT Enterprise must continually acquire new
capabilities in order to produce quality intelligence for its customers. We are always recognizing
new technologies, new equipment, and new skills that we will need now or in the future. The
SIGINT Director is responsible for making sure that all of these SIGINT-related requirements are
accounted for, prioritized, and included in the Agency's overall acquisition process. It is the role
of the SIGINT Requirements Oversight Board , or SROB, to help him do it.
(U//FOUO) The SROB is headed by SIGINT Director MG Quirk and is made up of permanent and
associate members .
(U//FOUO) The board acts as an integrator, providing General Quirk with a unified view all
SIGINT capability requirements, and provides a senior forum for the discussion of the future of
the SIGINT discipline. Through the participation of the Joint Staff and other members of the
Intelligence Community, the SROB allows SID to form partnerships and share information
regarding our collective visions of the future of SIGINT. It also serves as the formal body that
validates and/or certifies capability documents for release to the NSA/CSS Corporate Review
Group, the DIRNSA's body that validates and submits capability documents for Joint and
Community review.
(U//FOUO) As DoD and the Intelligence Community move to new and updated processes, the
SROB has been quick to react and remain consistent with new policy guidelines for major
acquisition programs. The SROB Secretariat, SIGINT Requirements (S01R), sends SROB
members draft versions of the documents to be discussed at least one week prior to meeting.
Final discussion of issues occurs at the SROB. With one Capstone Requirements Document**
(CRD) completed, six Operational Requirements Documents** (ORDs) in final review, and more
Capability Development Documents** (CDD) awaiting review, the SROB has been busy and
looks to remain engaged with decisions affecting the future SIGINT Enterprise.
(U) **Definitions:
CRD : Captures the overarching requirements for a mission area that forms a family-of-systems
or a system-of-systems.
ORD : A formatted document containing operational performance requirements for a single
proposed concept or system.
CDD : A document that captures the information necessary to develop a proposed program. The
CDD outlines an affordable increment of a useful, logistically supportable, and technically mature
capability.
