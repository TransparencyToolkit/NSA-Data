 SERIES: 
(U) Learned Orgs '05

(U) What is KRYPTOS?
(U) The KRYPTOS Society was established in 1981 to promote
interest in cryptanalysis, to provide a focal point for the fields of
common interest to cryptanalysts of the National Security Agency,
and to promote excellence in the cryptologic community. It has
since expanded with chapters at GCHQ, CSE and DSD, which has
members from GCSB as well. Although NSA's KRYPTOS has an
elected council of 8 members from the community, it cannot
function without volunteers from among the rest of the
approximately 250 members.
(U) What does KRYPTOS do?
(U) First, KRYPTOS sponsors several technical talks throughout
the year. These talks are given by members of the wider
cryptanalysis community and are hopefully of interest to
cryptanalysts, and are usually open to all cleared employees.
(U) In addition, KRYPTOS sponsors several annual activities to
recognize cryptanalytic excellence. The Cryptanalytic
Literature Competition is for papers written on topics clearly
relating to cryptanalysis and there is also a Technical Talk (on
video) competition which seeks to recognize the best technical
presentation on cryptanalysis or one of its related disciplines.
International panels of judges decide what papers and talks are
awarded (cash prizes). The Norman Roberts Award, also juried by
an international board, is sponsored by the Cheltenham Chapter to
recognize outstanding contributions by a junior analyst; finally
there is the Peter Jenks Community Service Award for NSA
KRYPTOS members only. In addition, KRYPTOS acts as a cosponsor
with the Cryptanalysis Skill Community for the prestigious Gold
Bug award.
(U) Starting the fall of 2005, there will be a "Cryptanalyst of the
Quarter" where a KRYPTOS member can nominate anyone for a
significant, but perhaps unheralded, cryptanalysis achievement in
the previous 6 months. The recipient will be awarded a gold coffee
mug with the KRYPTOS logo.
(U) KRYPTOS sponsors an annual luncheon/banquet where the
annual prizes are awarded and Distinguished Members from among
the retired cryptanalysts are honored (based on nominations from
the cryptanalysis community). In addition, we have sponsored a
strictly social event for the past several years: a CryptoMathematics Institute/KRYPTOS family night at a Bowie Baysox
baseball game.
(U) How do I join and what's in it for me?

1.  Have You Considered
Joining a Learned
Organization?
2.  The CryptoMathematics
Institute Has the

 (U) Cost of membership is $5 a calendar year. The money helps
fund the awards and a discount on the banquet cost for members.
As a KRYPTOS member you can participate in the annual November
election of council members (either by voting and/or running!).
You may also volunteer to help in the planning or executing of the
many activities.
