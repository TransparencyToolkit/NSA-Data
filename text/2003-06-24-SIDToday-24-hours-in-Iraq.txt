The below activity summary will give you an idea<br>of what happens during the course of a random day (14 June) in Iraq. This may seem to be a<br>large number of incidents, but this is actually representative of an average day-- and since<br>there were no U.S. fatalities, it could be considered a "good" day:<br>(S) The following events occured on 14 June in Iraq:<br>A retransmission site for the 101st Air Assault Division was fired on by an unknown<br>number of personnel. They returned fire and broke contact. No injuries.<br>A 1st Armored Division patrol in Baghdad received fire from one RPG (rocket-propelled<br>grenade). The RPG round went high and missed.

The checkpoint returned fire, but the vehicle fled. 1 x U.S. WIA<br>(multiple gunshot wounds).<br>A 101st Air Assault Division checkpoint in Mosul was attacked with small arms by two<br>individuals on motorcycles.
