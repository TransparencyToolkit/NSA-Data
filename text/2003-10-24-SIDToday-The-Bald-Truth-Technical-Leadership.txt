Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 10/24/2003<br><br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: this is the<br>first edition of "The Bald Truth" - articles from<br>Charles Berlin that will appear twice monthly.<br>(U) Some of the feedback from my previous articles asked about<br>my thoughts on technical leadership. As usual, I have an opinion let me know if you agree.<br>(U) First of all, we are a technical agency and always will be. Our<br>technical capabilities and high tech nature are found in the brains<br>of our people. Fundamentally, technical leadership has something<br>to do with leading technical people. We need to have strong<br>programs to hire, develop and retain technical people (BTW, as a<br>former East German linguist, I include language analysts and such<br>as technical people). We have some pretty good programs for this.<br>Technical leadership will have to be focused on the human capital.<br>Senior technical people have to lead, mentor and take<br>responsibility for building our future. Technical leadership also<br>entails keeping yourself current in your field.<br>(U) But there are several other aspects of this domain. First it is a<br>legitimate function of a technical leader to "tell the geeks when<br>they are done." Seems flip, I know, but no disrespect meant when<br>I tell you what you already know: software is never "done" and<br>somebody has to declare victory. Perfect really is the enemy of<br>good enough. We have pretty high standards, so "good enough"<br>never means shoddy or compromised, but let's face it: the job has<br>to be finished sometime . This decision is a skill that can be<br>learned, but it essentially comes from an exquisite understanding<br>of the requirements and a solid business sense for when they are<br>achieved (remember "Business Acumen"? You are supposed to<br>have some if you are a leader).<br>(U//FOUO) A second aspect of technical leadership is what I call<br>alignment. In the 70's we often built things because we could - if it<br>can be done, why not build it? In the 80's and 90's it had to be<br>feasible and also important. Now we have the third criterion: can<br>we afford it? This means that there are ideas and systems that are<br>feasible and even important that we will not build. No kidding, we<br>could have a lifesaving idea that will not make the cut. Technical<br>leadership has to draw that cut line. A technical leader does this by<br>reviewing the guidance and priorities that come from the strategic<br>plan and ensuring that every project and program conforms to that<br>plan. Further - and this is where the real technical part comes in the technical leader ensures that the solution is as efficient,<br>reusable and networked into the service-based architecture. For<br>instance, if you are building a database that does not use the PKI<br>architecture (or worse invents its own), then you are wrong. A<br>technical leader ensures this does not happen.<br>(U//FOUO) Technical leadership insists on a rigorous scrub of<br><br> SERIES: <br>The Bald Truth<br>1.

This third aspect is necessary for our<br>technical reputation but not sufficient. The last aspect of technical<br>leadership is the mandate to create. Technical leadership is about<br>sheer creativity. To be successful in the future we have to actually<br>invent new ideas, techniques and applications. We will look to the<br>technical leaders to come up with some no-kidding killer<br>applications. We want to massively surprise our enemies with<br>capabilities they cannot imagine. Our technical leadership can<br>imagine them and will. Invent anything lately?<br>(U) One last question: Is technical leadership an oxymoron? I don't<br>think so. Being a "techie" is not a license to withdraw from the<br>leadership field. Neither is grade. Wherever you find yourself,<br>whatever your grade, you must lead. Just do it.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
