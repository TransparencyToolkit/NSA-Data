(U) Guidance from the SIGINT Director on Machine Room
Management Procedures
FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 12/22/2005

(U//FOUO) The below message relates to EXECmessage-120: "Information Technology
Directorate Machine Room Management (MRM)"
(U) I want to add my endorsement to the subject procedures and my expectations for
compliance within the US SIGINT System (USSS). This initiative will enhance the overall
security, operations, safety, and cleanliness of our cryptologic machine rooms.
(U//FOUO) This is an important piece in our relationship to the Information Technology
Directorate (ITD) as part of USSS governance responsibility number 7 "To operate the stations,
facilities, and systems of the NSA Global SIGINT Enterprise as an effective and unified
organization." It will also improve the configuration control of IT equipment, USSS mission
applications, and data storage in ITD supported machine rooms, and strengthen our relationship
with ITD in areas of mutual interest. By improving our corporate governance and configuration
management practices, these procedures will improve the reliability of SIGINT systems and
make it easier to assess and repair mission systems in the future.
(U) My intent is that we should suffer no limitation to or loss of SIGINT support due to
preventable practices in our machine rooms.
(U//FOUO) ITD will host a number of information sessions to explain the new procedures and to
answer any questions about implementation-- watch for details of these sessions in agency_all
e-mails. I want to ensure that the SIGINT System is working with ITD to comply with these
procedures and is contributing to keeping them up to date, with the goal of improving the
safety, security, and operations of our machine rooms. I encourage the full engagement of the
USSS as we work to enhance the governance processes that will lead to the continual
improvement of our ability to produce SIGINT.
