During periods of intense diplomatic or military activity, there<br>is no better place to be in the thick of it. Each and every NSOC desk represents a larger Agency<br>element, and together the 36 desk officers working a given shift capture the extremely diverse<br>yet coordinated functions of approximately 15,000 people. Witnessing and participating in this<br>coordinated effort provides a top-down perspective no "Intro to NSA" class or Power Point<br>briefing can even come close to portraying.<br>(U//FOUO) The Reporting Cell in NSOC is home to the Senior Reporting Officer (SRO) and the<br>Reporting Officer (RO). These two individuals reside less than 20 feet from the Senior<br>Operations Officer (SOO) who is DIRSNA after-hours; and, together, these three individuals are<br>the only NSOC representatives authorized to act on behalf of the Chief of Customer Response<br>(CR) . The SOO relies on the Reporting Cell to keep him/her abreast of recent reporting and<br>dissemination issues. Additionally, the SRO and RO work intimately with other desks to ensure<br>that authorized customers receive needed intelligence legally, securely, reliably, accountably,<br>and on time.<br>(U//FOUO) These individuals are involved in everything from reviewing electrical product for<br>sensitive content and compliance with USSIDs, to composing and sending time-sensitive reports<br>whose critical nature can require that the President of the United States be immediately alerted<br>- even woken up! The Reporting Cell interacts with other SID desks representing every product<br>line and collection capability, as well as field sites, RSOCs and Second Party Partners. While<br>there are indeed moments when one can hardly catch one's breath, there are also those when<br>one has time to collaborate with and learn from mission elements not usually accessible to a<br>day-shop position. There is no better place to learn how this Agency accomplishes its mission.<br>(U//FOUO) But what about the shift-work? This seems to be the major reason most individuals<br>are unwilling to pursue a tour in NSOC. Waking up earlier than the crack of dawn to take on a<br>day shift or staying up all night for a mid may be as appealing as a trip to the dentist, but there<br>ARE advantages to the shift schedule. The camaraderie that comes hand-in-hand with working<br>day-in, day-out, night-in, night-out with IC (Intelligence Community) professionals on the same<br>rotating schedule is unparalleled, and being part of a close-knit team is both personally and<br>professionally rewarding. When on "straight days," Reporting Cell members have the option to<br>work within any CR mission element or A&amp;P; target office he/she chooses, to enjoy coordinated<br>trips or tours with his/her team (CIA, NIMA), to take classes or to use leave.<br>(U//FOUO) When not on duty, the SRO and RO are part of the many get-togethers NSOCers<br>enjoy to underscore the reality that just because one may be maintaining a far-from-traditional<br>schedule (and possibly having to put extra effort into keeping up with one's family and friends),<br>one is not without a fulfilling social life - and family! Other benefits include premium pay for<br>nights and weekends, and - one of the best - that you only work an 8-hour shift, after which<br>someone else relieves you to take on whatever loose thread may be hanging. What you leave<br>behind is not waiting for your return to the office!<br>(U//FOUO) SROs and ROs are afforded a truly unique opportunity not only to learn what is<br>policy vs. what is myth, but also to drive the very same system they work within on a daily<br>basis. That SRO and RO alumni reside at every level of NSA/CSS leadership is testimony to the<br>fact that taking on a Reporting Cell tour is among the most valuable career development<br>opportunities out there.
