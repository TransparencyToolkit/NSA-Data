Conference
FROM:
GCHQ Integree, SIGINT Development Strategy & Governance (SSG)
Run Date: 02/23/2005
(U//FOUO) Planning is currently underway for the second Pacific SIGINT Development
Conference to be hosted by Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC) from 19 to 21
April 2005.
(C) (C) The conference will focus on SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) in the Pacific and will
explore how Mission Alignment will affect that community, as well as examine orchestration and
collaboration across the Pacific SIGDEV community and between the Pacific-theater and NSAW
and Second Party partners.
(C) At last year's conference there was a healthy mix of Extended Enterprise representatives and
an NSAW contingent, as well as Second Party representatives from DSD and GCSB. This year we
are hoping to have representation from all Extended Enterprise SIGDEV elements in the region,
all Second Party Partners and increased participation from across SID and beyond.
(C//SI) The conference itself will consist of a series of briefings at TS//SI//REL TO USA, AUS,
CAN, GBR and NZL or below level from S2 Product Lines and Second Party partners as mission
owners, S3 participants as capability/solution providers, and Extended Enterprise elements
highlighting their SIGDEV successes over the past 12 months, as well as outlining their
capabilities and gaps. The briefings are not only intended to facilitate the exchange of
information, but to encourage discussions that will result in improvements to the SIGDEV
mission in the coming years.
