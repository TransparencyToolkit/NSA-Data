The only change is to the classification level. So, for example, changing<br>text from TS//SI to S//SI would be a downgrade, as would changing TOP SECRET<br>information to SECRET. In order to downgrade COMINT, a plausible cover (i.e., collection<br>from a less sensitive source) must exist.<br>(U//FOUO) The downgrading of U.S. COMINT is performed only by:<br>an Original Classification Authority (OCA) at NSA, in coordination with the Information<br>Security Policy office (DC322), or<br>personnel tasked specifically with the formal review and declassification of cryptologic<br>materials. (These are typically contractors working to comply with E.O. 12958, and does<br>not include anyone in the SIGINT Directorate below the level of OCA.)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
