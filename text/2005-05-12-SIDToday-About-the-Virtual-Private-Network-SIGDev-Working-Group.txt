(TS//SI) About the Virtual Private Network SIGDev Working Group...
FROM:
Chair NSA VPN WG, Advanced Network Development & Analysis (ANDA S31SD1)
Run Date: 05/12/2005
(TS//SI) If you are a SIGINT analyst whose target communicates via virtual private networks
(VPNs), I'd like to tell you about the VPN SIGDev Working Group. The WG was established in
November 2004 to conduct systematic and thorough SIGINT Development of VPN
communications (typically encrypted). ANDA provides regular VPN Target Activity Reports on a
number of countries and target entities including Bahrain, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India,
Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Turkey, UAE, Yemen, and specific financial, governmental, communication service providers and
international organizations. These reports may help you exploit targets' VPNs more successfully.
(S//SI) Members of the working group include a diverse group of individuals from the Network
Analysis Center (S31SD), Network Security Products (S31213), Office of Target Pursuit (S311),
and a number of S2 product lines, including MENA (S2E), International Security Issues (S2C),
Office of China & Korea (S2B), Office of Russia (S2H), Office of Regional Targets (S2A), and
Office of Proliferation and Arms Control (S2G). New members are always welcome!
(S//SI) The VPN SIGDev WG is a subgroup of the larger NSA VPN Working Group. To learn more,
type "go vpnwg" in your browser. If you have questions, contact
