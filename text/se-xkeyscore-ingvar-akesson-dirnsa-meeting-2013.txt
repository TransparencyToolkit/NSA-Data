future areas of collaboration. It also presents an opportunity for NSA/CSS leadership to
reiterate their commitment to the Swedish partnership.

VISITOR REQUESTED:

•	(TS//REL USA, SWE) FRA requested a WINTERLIGHT (Quantum project) update and
asked to hear about our plans for sharing reports on Quantum tipping or intercepts from
the Quantum tipping. FRA plans to start the conference by giving an overview of its
S1GINT Roadmap, to include Russia,

. It will also provide a Cyber update—specifically

COMMON THREADS:

•	(S//REL TO USA, SWE) Emphasize the value of the NSA-FRA partnership.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

(S//REL USA, SWE) Recommend General Alexander and D/DIR emphasize the following

points:

Quantum Operations:

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Acknowledge the success that NSA, FRA, and GCHQ
have had on WINTERLIGHT. Last month, we received a message from our Swedish
partner that GCHQ received FRA QUANTUM tips that led to 100 shots, five of which
were successfully redirected to the GCHQ server. The Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)
confirmed with Tailored Access Operations (TAO) that this validates the "proof of
concept" that was originally trying to be accomplished. Additionally, FAD, TAO, and
Enterprise Information Technology Services are still working through the technical
solution to have FRA tip directly to NSA. S3 Data Acquisitions’ goal is to have a
solution for a direct tip to FRA operational by this summer. The Quantum effort
motivated the recent XKEYSCORE installation. FRA is currently evaluating it for use to
support their SIGINT Development work.

Cable Access/Reporting and Analysis:

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Highlight that NSA/CSS would like to continue to
collaborate on FRA’s cable access program, which has resulted in unique SIGINT
reporting on a variety of high-priority SIGINT topics (123 reports thus far this fiscal
year). FRA continues to gain access to more data from additional telecommunications
companies, making the cable access potentially lucrative for NSA/CSS for targets beyond
Russia.

Cyber:

•	(TS//REL TO USA, SWE) Stress that NTOC is ready to seriously engage with FRA on
cyber defense. Mr. Akesson has reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
and has no changes; therefore, we would like to have an official signing during the

24	April 1130-1200 discussions.

•	(TS//S1//NF) NTOC shared some information with FRA about a Swedish intrusion in
November 2012. FRA came in with questions in February 2013 that led NTOC to do
more analysis. Subsequently, NTOC reached the same conclusion as FRA, that it
involved the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. FRA asked if it could alert Israel and NTOC
agreed that it could tell Israel about the intrusion. Israel’s identity was never
compromised.

Secure VTC Capability

•	(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Encourage FRA to set up its equipment soonest to allow for
secure VTC capability. That capability already exists with Norway and Denmark and has
shown benefit in expanding analytic collaboration on a myriad of issues. FRA’s
technology directorate is just waiting on requirements from its SIGINT directorate to be
able to finalize the set-up and installation.

Counterterrorism:

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) NSA/CSS’ Counterterrorism (CT) analysts and FRA
continue to cooperate and collaborate on CT threat-related activities in Europe. Several
analyst-to-analyst meetings have taken place and European Cryptologic Center (ECC) in
Darmstadt, Germany, is formally coordinating a Staff Processing Form (SPF) to have
Sweden assist NSA/CSS with high-priority CT Swedish language traffic that ECC is
currently unable to fully analyze. In January 2013, CT established its first CT deployed
analyst position in Stockholm. Also in January, FRA and SAPO were legally allowed to
collaborate after a 4-year hiatus.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Encourage increased collaboration on CT threat streams.

Russia:

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Thank Sweden for its continued work on the Russian

target, and underscore the primary role that FRA plays as a leading partner to work the
Russian target, including Russian leadership, energy,	and , and

counterintelligence. FRA’s cable access has resulted in unique SIGINT reporting on all
of these areas.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, SWE) Encourage continued collaboration and sharing of reporting
on Russian topics.
