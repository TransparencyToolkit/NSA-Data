(S//SI) Here's a reader's comment on the recent article New Release Caveat on the Way :
From: 
Comment: (U//FOUO) I'm curious about the notion of a "new DCI Directive" at this particular
juncture, given there is no longer a "DCI", and one would assume no further DCIDs would be
issued until the DNI's office and staff fully stand up and things get shaken out, so to speak. Just
last week the DNI's office issued directives specifying (inter alia) that all existing DCIDs should
be considered to be "Intelligence Community Directives" and would remain in force until further
notice. Given that the thinking and impetus behind the directive outlined in the article were the
product of the CIA-centric Community Management Staff, I would think the new DNI
administration would want to carefully consider any pending directives, particularly one as
potentially high impact as this, to determine if it was consistent with their vision and direction
for the intelligence sharing environment, or if other, more sweeping and fundamental changes,
such as elimination of the "presumption of NOFORN" (the source of the problem the new DCID
seeks to fix), might better serve the IC's and the country's security and info sharing needs.
