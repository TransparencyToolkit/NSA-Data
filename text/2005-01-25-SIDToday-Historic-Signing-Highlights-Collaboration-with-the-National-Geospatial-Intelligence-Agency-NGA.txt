(U//FOUO) Historic Signing Highlights Collaboration with the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
FROM:
NGA Account Manager (S112)
Run Date: 01/25/2005
(U//FOUO) At the most recent NSA-NGA Quarterly on 16 Dec 2004, Lt Gen Hayden and NGA
Director Air Force Lt Gen James R. Clapper Jr., (Retired) signed a "Special Topic" on NSA-NGA
Horizontal Integration that spells out the collaborative measures the agencies have undertaken
to optimize results from both agencies' efforts. Working together from start to finish, using
NGA's "eyes" and NSA's "ears" -- makes it possible to solve intelligence challenges that cannot
be resolved through separate application of normal SIGINT or GEOINT methods.
(U//FOUO) The "Special Topic" is to be included in the Congressional Budget Justification Book
that both agencies submit to Congress in February. This topic, jointly prepared by NSA and NGA,
documents the close collaboration and information sharing that began in 2001 and continues to
expand. It provides an overview of more than thirty activities initiated by the two
agencies to link their sources, data holdings, information infrastructure, and exploitation
techniques.
(U//FOUO) This document reflects the results of the close collaboration that Director Clapper
and Lt Gen Hayden discussed at the October GEOINT 2004 Symposium in New Orleans and
highlights the agencies' joint accomplishments.
