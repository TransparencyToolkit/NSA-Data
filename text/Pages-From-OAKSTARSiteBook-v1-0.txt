(U) Introduction

(U//FOUO) This handbook will familiarize travelers with the tools to prepare them for
traveling under the OAKSTAR program. Details of responsibility and the identification of
key support organizations are included.

(U) Background

(TS//SI//NF) Traveling for OAKSTAR primarily involves traveling within the continental
United States. The first name of each of the below bullets refers to the SSO project
name; the second name is the name the NSA/CSS Commercial Solutions Center
(NCSC) identifies the partner relationship by. SSO and NCSC jointly administer the
programs with each of the below partners. Currently, the following are supported under
this program:

•

I

I
I

I

. MONKEYROCKET - The term THUNDERISLAND refers to the partner
identity._______________________________________________

(TS//SI//NF) These programs involve ventures with US companies. While the travel is
mostly U//FOUO with respect to the cities traveled to, the identities of persons and
companies met, addresses of facilities, etc. are protected under the SSO WHIPGENIE
ECI and the NCSC AAA ECI. Therefore, you must currently hold one of the two ECl’s to
travel within the program. If you currently do not hold the ECl’s and are in need of
traveling for the program, you must first speak to the Program Director (PD), Deputy
Program Director (DPD) or Mission Program Manager (MPM) in advance of the travel
date.

(U) General Authority

(U) Locally or Continental United States

(C) The Special Source Operations (SSO), Program Management Division (PMD)
coordinates interaction with the Partner, approves funding for TDYs, handles interaction
with NCSC, and helps with the passing of clearances as appropriate. This includes
working with SSO Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) and Operations and
Discovery Division (ODD) reps, as well as other government agencies to accomplish
this task.

(U) CONUS

(U//FOUO) Every trip should have a designated team lead. The team leader is
responsible for the technical aspects of the deployment. This includes providing timely
updates to the OAKSTAR PMD team at NBP320. Normally, a PMD member will take
this role if on the TDY. The person assigned as the lead for the visit is required to
submit a Trip Report within five days of the conclusion of the visit. Contact PMD for the
template and/or a sample from a previous visit, if needed.

(U) Travel

(U//FOUO) Contractors are generally not allowed to travel on these programs or meet
with the partners. If an exception must be made, the contractor will need to see the PD
or DPD with advance notice, and coordination will be initiated with NCSC.

(C) The PD, DPD or MPM will be in charge of arranging all meetings with the Partners,
sometimes in conjunction with the NCSC PD. The arrangements can be delegated to
ODD/ETS reps as required.

(U) Travel Planning and Planning Message

(U//FOUO) LL42 Corporate Travel Services (on the NSA Intranet at “go travel”) can
assist with all aspects of official travel to include information on government travel
charge cards, reservations via^^^^^^^| official government passports, Request
for Travel Authorization (RTA) forms, travel checklists and much more.	will also

schedule rental cars and hotels. As with all travel, always check rental car and actual
expenses as authorized.

(TS//NF) Here is some helpful travel information.

(C) Guidelines and Rules for Partner Visits, Interaction, etc.

(TS//SI//NF) TDY and partner interaction with these programs is very sensitive and not
like a typical trip to a contractor facility or a DOD installation. The following guidance
must be followed. Failure to comply with these measures could result in detrimental
damage to the mission of the program.

•	(C) Locations vary throughout the Continental US with the exception of
MONKEYROCKET and^^^^^^^ which forward data from the ETC,
Weisbaden, GE.

applicable).

at certain sites. If in the military, do not wear your uniform. Check with the PD for
guidance on proper attire before traveling.

•	(S//NF) Remain courteous to all Partners. Remember this is a partnership as much
as a contractual relationship. Partners may not necessarily be accustomed to doing
work with the government. Generally, these business associates are extremely
patriotic, and deserve to be treated with the utmost respect and courtesy. While we
typically have a contractual relationship with the company we work with, these efforts
are more a partnership then a classic DOD contract.

•	(S//NF) Always be aware of your audience. Remain cognizant of the clearance level
of the person(s) you are speaking with or meeting with. Remember NEVER
DISCUSS OR SHARE ANOTHER PARTNERS INFORMATION!

•	(S//NF) Witting vs. Non Witting. No assumptions should be made that all people at
the company are cleared to the NSA relationship. You should only be working with
the people that are cleared. This is a case-by-case occurrence.

(U) Process for TDY

1.	(U//FOUO) Send an email or discuss the details on the proposed trip with the
PMD rep. These trips can also be discussed over the phone or at team meetings.
Include the following information:

b.	Traveling Cell Phone Number (if available)

c.	Dates

d.	Purpose

iii.	Date of Birth

iv.	Social Security Number

v.	Contractor - company name

vi.	GS rating or equivalent

2.	(U//FOUO) Clearances for all OAKSTAR team members are sent in December
each year for the entire next calendar year but new team members or non-team
members traveling on behalf of OAKSTAR should check with PMD first and be
prepared to provide the information above in 1.e. i-vi.

3.	(U//FOUO) A PMD rep will confirm approval or disapproval. Once approved,
since PMD finances the trip you should prepare an RTA for PMD signature
approval (PD & D/PD) with a ‘CC’ to your division leadership for information only.
PMD will sign and forward the RTA to the OAKSTAR budget representative for
