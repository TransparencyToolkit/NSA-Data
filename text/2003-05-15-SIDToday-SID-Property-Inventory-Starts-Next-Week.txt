DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Property Inventory Starts Next Week<br>FROM:<br>Chief, SIGINT Support Services<br>Run Date: 05/15/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) The SID 2003 Property Inventory is set to begin 19 May 2003. It may seem that we<br>just completed an inventory... and you would be correct: the 2002 inventory was completed on<br>6 March 2003 as the result of an extension. The results of that inventory were that only 97% of<br>the equipment was located, or another way to say it was that more then $27M of SID equipment<br>was "unaccounted for". The final report for the 2002 inventory has not been signed by the DIR<br>C/S.<br>(U//FOUO) The requirement for Property Accountability is outlined in US law, DOD accounting<br>manuals, NSA/CSS Directives and Regulations. NSA performs inventories for numerous reasons,<br>the first to ensure we can account for the equipment we should have on hand to apply against<br>mission requirements. Another reason is it's the law and we're trying to keep people out of jail.<br>The regulations require that all equipment with an acquisition cost of $5000 or more (as of July<br>2001) and all computers, regardless of cost to include laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc. be<br>accounted for. The entire SID Property Accountability program includes data base management,<br>tagging new equipment, tracking equipment transfers, monitoring the shipping of property and<br>assisting in the turn-in or excessing of equipment. Also included laptop/palmtop inventories,<br>development of Property Policy and assisting in training Property Officers.<br>(U//FOUO) We hope the 2003 inventory will be easier, shorter and will achieve better results.<br>The objective is accounting for 100% of the equipment and we must finish by 31 December<br>2003. We hope that with support from senior SID leadership coupled with buy-in and support at<br>all levels of SID, that this inventory will be more successful, less painful and achieve better<br>results. It will require management awareness and commitment to make it happen. To reach our<br>goal we will need the support of everyone in SID. We hope to get some of the gaps in Property<br>Officers filled, train them and support them in performing their duties. As the inventory<br>progresses we will use tools such as this to communicate how inventory is going. We need to<br>achieve 100% accountability.<br>(U//FOUO) If you're interested in knowing more about Property Accountability we suggest you<br>visit the SID Property Web page for a better understanding of what this program is all about.
