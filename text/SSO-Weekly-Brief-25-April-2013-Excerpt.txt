(TS//SI//NF) S2I12 issued a single source report based on PRISM Skype
collection on 10 April 2013 describing U.S.-based Uzbek refugee
Fazliddin Kurbanov’s discussions with Pakistan-based Islamic
Movement of Uzbekistan official Adnan (3/00/511915-13). Kurbanov
expressed desire to attack the US in previous reporting and discussed
explosives work. This report described how Kurbanov believed he was
under surveillance (which he is by the FBI) but was cautiously
continuing his work, which was not specified - could be raising money
for the IMU or explosives testing. Adnan wanted Kurbanov to set this
work in motion, probably related to sending money back to the IMU.
Kurbanov previously promised Adnan that he would raise money in the
United States for the IMU. See 3/00/506950-13 282022Z FEB 13
