While the weather does take away some outdoor playtime<br>opportunities, it also offers a terrific opportunity to curl up with a fantastic book that is likely the<br>strike the fancy of many NSA employees. Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon , a New York Times<br>bestseller, takes the reader on a journey from World War II to the present in a historically<br>fictional representation of the development of cryptology, the breaking of the ENIGMA, the birth<br>of the computer, and the founding of the National Security Agency.<br>(U) The book weaves in and out of two major storylines: the mesmerizing life of Lawrence<br>Pritchard Waterhouse, a mathematical, code-breaking genius, and his participation in World War<br>II; and Waterhouse's grandson Randy who takes after his grandfather, but now, in a<br>technologically-advanced society. Stephenson has produced an enthralling work that proves to<br>be as much of a history lesson as an eye-opening thriller. As an NSA employee, it is particularly<br>entertaining to read the depictions of intelligence officials and code-breakers from days long<br>past, and days more recent. It's a thick one, but well worth the time investment! What better<br>way to take advantage of the rain than to add a new book to your list of favorites!<br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
