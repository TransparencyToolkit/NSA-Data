The idea is to bring together<br>communications from across the SIGINT Directorate in a single webpage. This should provide a<br>good picture of what's going on in SID, and enable easy access. Let's go on a quick tour<br>(U//FOUO) First, at the top of the page are your links to the SID Homepage and NSA Daily.<br>Next, you will notice a big article on the left side of the page. This is the lead message, which<br>will change daily. It may consist of notes from management {the format of the former Messages<br>of the Day} or just general information of interest. To the right of this, there is space for one or<br>two other articles {such as this one}, allowing the flexibility to present a variety of information.<br>(U//FOUO) Links to Latest News items, such as SID-all messages, can be found on the far right<br>side of the page in the black box. Elsewhere on the page are links to:<br>SID Notes/Reports<br>Calendars<br>Workforce Outreach programs {such as Mo's Mailbag and What's on Your Mind} and<br>information on the Iraq Campaign and Campaign Against Terrorism.<br>You will also see links to SID Today archives and our feedback page.<br>(U//FOUO) We owe many, many thanks to the folks in Multimedia Solutions for putting this<br>together for us! Please take some time to explore the new page and use the feedback button to<br>let us know of any suggestions you may have-- we'll continue to grow over the coming weeks<br>and months. Tell us what you'd like to see here. If you have an article you'd like to run, send it<br>to S02C_all and we'll take it from there.<br>The SIGINT Communications Team<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
