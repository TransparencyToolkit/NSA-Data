DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Introducing Carl Johnson as Assistant Deputy Director for<br>Customer Relationships<br>FROM: Carl Johnson<br>(Dateline 5 June)<br>Run Date: 06/26/2003<br>(U//FOUO) I am honored, humbled, and pleased to have been<br> SERIES: <br>selected as the new Assistant Deputy Director for Customer<br>(U) Getting to Know the<br>Relationships. <br> the newly named Deputy Director for<br>SID Leadership Team<br>Customer Relationships, is currently completing the Foreign Service<br>Institute (FSI) Senior Seminar. We expect her to officially come onboard in mid-July. In the meantime, I have been simultaneously<br>1.  Coming Soon:<br>learning all I can, and as quickly as I can, about the Customer<br>Getting to Know the<br>Relationships Directorate (CRD) and have been representing CRD's<br>SID Leadership Team<br>interests and equities as the Acting Deputy Director for Customer<br>2.  Introducing Jim<br>Relationships.<br>Allen, Incoming<br>Deputy Director for<br>(U//FOUO) By way of introduction, my background falls entirely<br>Analysis and<br>within operations. I started my career working Russia but have<br>Production<br>spent the bulk of my time working China and Korea. My most<br>3.  Jack Israel, A&amp;P;'s<br>recent position was as Chief of the Analysis and Production, China<br>Senior Technical<br>&amp; Korea Product Line (S2B). In the former Directorate of<br>Leader<br>Operations (DO) Asia and Pacific organization (B Group), I served<br>4.  Introducing Carl<br>as the B Group Executive Officer and in NSOC as a B (Group)<br>Johnson as Assistant<br>Senior Group Coordinator (BSGC). I also led the B Group Customer<br>Deputy Director for<br>Relations Division of the Staff. Along the way, I attended the Air<br>Customer<br>War College and Marine Corps Command and Staff College.<br>Relationships<br>5.  Introduction to <br>(U//FOUO) Since 19 May, my first full day on the job in CRD, I've<br> Customer<br>moved my office and established an office staff; and by the end of<br>Relationships<br>June, I'll have toured the CRD spaces and met the workforce. I've<br>Director<br>also attended the recent SID Leadership off-sites. These off-sites<br>have been invaluable for all of us, whether new to SID Leadership<br>or not. In this short period of time, we have not only gotten to<br>know each other on a personal basis but have also established the<br>basic precepts for making continual improvements in how we "take<br>care of business." Reaching this point of mutual understanding and<br>agreement would have taken several months of sandwiching<br>disjointed meetings between daily operational fire fighting. Whew all this in less than a month on the job!<br>(U//FOUO) I view CRD as the flash point for bringing the<br>customers (along with all their diverse needs and missions)<br>together with the SIGINT System (along with all its bureaucracies<br>and transformation growing pains) to create SIGINT successes for<br>the nation. Accomplishing this is a tricky business and seldom as<br>straightforward as much of the work done in the rest of SID. In<br>saying this, I'm not talking about the technical complexity of the<br>work. Instead, I'm talking about the difficulty of establishing and<br>maintaining the processes that effectively bring people together at<br>many levels - personally, organizationally, and technically - in an<br>ever-changing environment.<br>(U//FOUO) The team approach-- within CRD, throughout SID, and<br>indeed across the entire Intelligence Community-- is the only way<br>to go. Only through teaming and collaboration will we achieve<br>high-level successes across the board instead of uneven pockets of<br><br> </p>success, failure, and mediocrity. I encourage everyone to enjoy,<br>relax, and celebrate! Our jobs are hard but we must appreciate,<br>respect, and celebrate each other and our successes. We want an<br>atmosphere that promotes creative thinking and risk taking<br>together with responsibility and accountability. We also need the<br>wisdom to grow our future through responsible delegation of<br>authority throughout the entire workforce.<br>(U//FOUO) Finally, I truly appreciate the warm welcome and<br>outstanding support I've already received during my short tenure<br>in CRD. I'm really looking forward to the exciting times ahead and<br>to working with each of you to produce the SIGINT successes that<br>will help ensure our nation's security, freedoms, and way of life.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
