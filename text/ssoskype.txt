(TS//SI//NF) On 15 March 2013, SSO's PRISM program began tasking all
Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype because Skype allows users to log in
using account identifiers in addition to Skype usernames. Until now, PRISM
would not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other
than the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action
will mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any
e-mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow
analysts to task these non-Microsoft e-mail addresses to PRISM, however,

SSO intends to fix that this summer. In the meantime, NSA, FBI and Dept| of
Justice coordinated over the last six months to gain approval for PRINTAURA
to send all current and future Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype. This
resulted in about 9800 selectors being sent to Skype and successful
collection has been received which otherwise would have been missed.
