(U//FOUO) Coming Soon: A SID Classification Guide

Also: a new development with the e-mail CLASSIFY tool...
(U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) A new SID Classification Guide (as opposed to the
NSA/CSS Classification Manual) is on the way! It will significantly
revamp what is considered COMINT. A lot of information
previously covered by CCO or COMINT or SI will be proposed for
handling outside SI channels. The new guidelines will be very
different from what we've known in the past. The guide should be
out for review in the coming weeks.

Classification Manual

2.  Coming Soon: A SID
Classification Guide

(U//FOUO) Regarding the CLASSIFY tool for e-mail: the version
that's soon to be deployed uses REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL
as the default (and note that the "and" is gone before NZL... that's
the new format). All COMINT that is not marked NOFORN is
automatically REL 5-eyes. The 5-eyes designator should be
removed from your e-mail classification markings if your e-mail
includes COMINT because the marking is then redundant (i.e.
COMINT without any special handling caveat is assumed to be
releasable to 5-EYES).
