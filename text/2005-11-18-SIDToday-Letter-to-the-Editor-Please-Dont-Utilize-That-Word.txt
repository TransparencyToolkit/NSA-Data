(U) The recent article (U) Acronyms Anonymous touched on the benefits
Maj Gen Morrison
of using short, simple words over longer ones. This reminded a few
readers of a noteworthy NSA memo from many years ago. The memo
was issued by NSA's Assistant Director for Production, Maj Gen John E.
Morrison, USAF (pictured) on 28 December 1971, and read in its entirety:
Subject: Utilization
Please stop utilizing "utilize" and utilize "use."

(U) Thanks to the Center for Cryptologic History for providing a copy of this memo. See also a
bio of Maj Gen Morrison .
