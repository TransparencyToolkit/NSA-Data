(S//SI)	Back	in	Time:	A	Look	at	the	US-ROK	SIGINT	Relationship
FROM:
Country	Desk	Officer	for	Korea	(DP15)
Run	Date:	04/21/2005

(S//SI)	The	SIGINT	relationship	with	the	Republic	of	Korea	(ROK)	began	initially	as	a	way	of
ensuring	a	steady	flow	of	SIGINT	to	American	forces	during	wartime,	and	even	with	the
cessation	of	hostilities,	the	primary	concern	of	U.S.	planners	remained	war-related.	The	fact	that
its	primary	reason	for	existence	revolved	around	issues	of	peace	and	war	allowed	the
relationship	to	remain	under	NSA	aegis	rather	than	reverting	to	CIA	control.	This	in	turn
influenced	the	course	taken	in	managing	subsequent	foreign	relations.
(S//SI)	At	the	time	of	the	armistice	in	1953,	the	cryptologic	community	took	stock	of	its
operations	in	Korea,	assessed	future	needs	in	terms	of	threat	and	resources	to	meet	the	threat,
and	made	arrangements	to	implement	these	assessments.	In	reevaluating	wartime
arrangements,	the	US	cryptologic	community	found	them	unsatisfactory	for	a	number	of	reasons
and	sought	to	reshape	the	US-ROK	SIGINT	relations	in	beneficial	ways.
(S//SI)	The	process	began	with	temporizing	measures	to	ensure	the	flow	of	signals	intelligence
to	US	forces	in	Korea;	was	followed	by	a	period	of	uncertainty	in	which	senior	intelligence
officials	discussed	options	in	policy;	and	concluded	with	the	negotiation	of	a	bilateral	agreement
concerning	SIGINT.	In	undertaking	this	process,	the	US	forced	the	consolidation	of	two	existing
ROK	military	SIGINT	units	into	an	organization	loosely	modeled	on	its	US	counterparts,	creating
for	the	ROK	a	national	SIGINT	service.	At	the	same	time,	the	US	established	its	own	entity,	the
United	Stated	Special	Liaison	Advisor	Korea	(SUSLAK),	to	deal	with	the	new	organization.
(S//SI)	The	central	ROK	SIGINT	authority,	The	Defense	Security	Agency	(DSA),	subordinate	to
the	Ministry	of	National	Defense,	was	created	at	the	time	the	bilateral	agreement	became
effective	on	10	January	1956.	
	was	appointed	as	Director,	DSA,	with
	as	his	deputy.	
,	from	the	Pacific	Division	of
NSA's	Office	of	Analysis,	was	nominated	as	the	first	Chief	of	SUSLAK	on	6	December	1955.
(S//SI)	The	ROK-US	agreement	marked	several	new	developments	in	Third	Party
relations.	For	one	thing,	it	was	negotiated	and	managed	by	NSA	instead	of	CIA,	a	departure
from	past	practice.	The	value	of	the	agreement	is	borne	out	by	its	longevity	and	its	stability.
Despite	the	fluctuation	in	relations	between	the	two	countries	in	the	early	years,	the	SIGINT
relationship	has	continued	--	and	deepened.	Over	many	decades	it	has	proved	a	strong
cornerstone	of	US	SIGINT	policy	in	East	Asia.
