XSS is becoming less and less viable with each passing day. It?s just
too hard to develop and too easy to circumvent. Because of this (and
other technical/OPSEC issues), the bulk spam mission is becoming
less and less viable as well.

The new exploit hotness is Quantum. Certain Quantum missions have
a success rate as high as 80%, where spam is less than 

So, as spam and in?line XSS slowly fade away, the new exploit
development push is for those utilizing MitM or MotS capabilities, as
well as many other very unique techniques.

Bottom line if we can get the target to visit us in some sort of web
browser, we can probably own them. The only limitation is the ?how?.

   

 

WILLOWVIXEN

WILLOWVIXEN is a technique that permits exploitation by
having the target browse to a website by clicking on a link in
an email that we sent. The WILLOWVIXEN server receives
the contact from the target and performs a redirection.

SECONDDATE

- SECONDDATE is an exploitation technique that takes advantage of
web-based protocols and man-in-the-middle (MitM) positioning.

- SECONDDATE in?uences real-time communications between client
and server and can quietly redirect web-browsers to FA servers for
individual client exploitation.

- This allows mass exploitation potential for clients passing through
network choke points, but is configurable to provide surgical target
selection as well.
