FOXACID these days...

•	XSS is becoming less and less viable with each passing day. It’s just
too hard to develop and too easy to circumvent. Because of this (and
other technical/OPSEC issues), the bulk spam mission is becoming
less and less viable as well.

•	The new exploit hotness is Quantum. Certain Quantum missions have
a success rate as high as 80%, where spam is less than 1%.

•	So, as spam and in-line XSS slowly fade away, the new exploit
development push is for those utilizing MitM or MotS capabilities, as
well as many other very unique techniques.

•	Bottom line - if we can get the target to visit us in some sort of web
browser, we can probably own them. The only limitation is the “how”.

WILLOWVIXEN

WILLOVWIXEN is a technique that permits exploitation by
having the target browse to a website by clicking on a link in
an email that we sent. The WILLOVWIXEN server receives
the contact from the target and performs a redirection.

SECONDDATE

•	SECONDDATE is an exploitation technique that takes advantage of
web-based protocols and man-in-the-middle (MitM) positioning.

•	SECONDDATE influences real-time communications between client
and server and can quietly redirect web-browsers to FA servers for
individual client exploitation.

•	This allows mass exploitation potential for clients passing through
network choke points, but is configurable to provide surgical target
selection as well.
