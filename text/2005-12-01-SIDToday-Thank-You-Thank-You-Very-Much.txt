(U) Thank You, Thank You Very Much!

Run Date: 12/01/2005

Wednesday marked the official end of the 2005 Combined Federal Campaign and I am as proud
as I have ever been to be a part of the SID work force.
At a time when there are so many organizations looking for support to meet an abundance of
needs, SID rose to the occasion. You met the SID campaign goal of $700k and are within $22.5k
of hitting the stretch goal of $750k we set for ourselves--how amazing is that!. Totals will
continue to climb as additional donations are tallied. Remember, the CFC office will accept
contributions through the end of December. In the end though, this hasn't been about meeting
an organization's goal so much as it has been about delivering a measure of support consistent
with the need. You are a generous work force and I know many of you give time and treasure to
organizations outside this annual campaign. Thank you all.
I am especially grateful for the energetic and enthusiastic support of the Coordinators and
Canvassers who fanned out across SID to extend awareness of the campaign, answer your
questions and collect your donations. I would like to extend a special thanks to
(S02L), Cindy Beck (S2L),
 (S12), and
 (S3) who served as Coordinators.
They will continue assist with the distribution of gift awards. If you have one coming and haven't
been contacted in the next week, please follow-up with the Coordinator for your area.
Thank you again for your terrific support.
