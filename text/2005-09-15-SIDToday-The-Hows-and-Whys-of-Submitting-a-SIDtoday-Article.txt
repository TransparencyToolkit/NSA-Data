(U) The How's and Why's of Submitting a SID today Article
FROM: the editor
Unknown
Run Date: 09/15/2005

(U) How do articles wind up on SID today ? Who can contribute? If you've ever wondered about
these questions, read on...
(U) So, who can submit articles?
(U//FOUO) That's easy - anyone! People sometimes think that their management is supposed to
task them with writing a SID today story. Well, their management can , of course, and that's a
good thing. But anyone can take the initiative to propose a story. If you find yourself thinking, "I
wonder if others would like to know about this?" - it's time to take action.
(U) What's the difference between NSA Daily and SID today ?
(U//FOUO) Articles on Daily are of interest to the entire Agency work force. SID today articles
are geared towards people in SID, and SIGINTers in general -- wherever in the world they may
be. NSA Daily is administered by NSA Internal Communications (DC6C2); SID today is published
by SIGINT Communications (S02C).
(U) I have an idea for a SID today article I'd like to write. What do I do?
(U//FOUO) It's a good idea to tip us (S02C) off about your article before you start writing it - we
may be able to steer you in a certain direction that will save effort in the long run. The
mechanics of it are this: On the right-hand side of the SID today homepage, you'll see a
"Submit an Item" function. Click on the drop-down arrow and select "SID today article." Once
we take a look, we'll contact you.
(U) Who in SID decides what actually gets posted on SID today ? Does MG Quirk or
someone like that have to approve everything?
(U//FOUO) No way! S02C publishes the page. Specifically, the SID today editor makes decisions
about what gets posted, on what day, etc. We have a "newspaper" format, rather than a solely
"message from management" format. Why? -- We want to give everyone the opportunity to
pass on useful information and opinions to the work force. SID briefly had a "message from
management" format a few years ago, but this was jettisoned in favor of this more "populist"
approach. That's why we have bylines for our articles - you are reading one well-informed
person's opinion, not necessarily the "official SID position" on everything.
(U) Are most article ideas accepted?
(U) Yes. The great majority of articles we receive are posted. If a submission isn't publishable,
we'll try to suggest ways to make it so.
(U) I don't have time to write, but I want to put out an article. What can be done?
(U//FOUO) S02C can and does help write articles. If you supply us with the information you
want to convey, we'll put it into an article format and run it by you for review.
(U) Anything else?
(U) Yes -- Feedback welcome!

"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet

 without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."
