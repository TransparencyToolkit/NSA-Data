(U//FOUO) Recent Enhancements to the PLUS Database
FROM:
PLUS Team (S111)
Run Date: 02/24/2005

"Adding" features to PLUS...(U)
(U//FOUO) PLUS is a management information system for SIGINT Production which contains
statistical information and feedback about SIGINT serialized reports produced by NSAW, the
RSOCs, US Field Sites, and Second and Third Parties. In addition, it contains a database retrieval
tool as well as a KLIEGLIGHT tool. PLUS receives data from the SKYCAST database.
(U//FOUO) On 10 January 2005, the PLUS database started to include a new reporting vehicle:
First Instance Reporting (FIR) under "Report Kind EGRAM." (See related article .) FIR
coversheet information will be retrievable via the current PLUS Interface. FIR source records will
be added, once the technical details are completed. Any Feedback on FIRs can be forwarded
once the report is in PLUS. FIRs will be included in any EGRAM pulls. FIR serials can be
recognized as having a dash preceding the 1-up serial number, e.g. 3/3R/-0001-05.
(U//FOUO) In addition to the aforementioned FIR report type, here are some PLUS-related
accomplishments from 2004 and where we are headed in 2005:
(U//FOUO) 2004 Highlights
In January, NSA began an exchange of selected product source data with Canada's
Communications Security Establishment (CSE) modeled on the exchange already in place
with UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). We also began
discussions with Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) and New Zealand's
Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) on a similar exchange. These
exchanges have resulted in a nearly 50% increase in additional source records per month
in PLUS related to Second Party-issued reports.
A major upgrade of the PLUS SYBASE database software was implemented on 3 May
which allowed PLUS to expand the lengths of many fields.
Also in May, PLUS version 5.5 was released, which included many bug fixes, and
additions to the number of limiters and breakouts. A major feature was the ability to add
additional report types.
In June, as a result of the May release, report type SIGINT On Demand (SOD) was added
with data backloaded to the beginning of January 2004.
In November, a change to the NSRP feed process was implemented which reduced the
daily load time (during which the PLUS database is unavailable to users) by two hours.
New discussions began with various data system owners to export SKYCAST data to other
databases, notably RUMCAY, SCORPIOFORE, and more recently, KSP and RAINMAN.
(U//FOUO) 2005 Initiatives
A new PLUS Account Request Form was made available on the PLUS Web page in January
2005.
The SKYCAST server was relocated to Serverland on 15 Feb. This has resulted in a
significantly faster system response time and thus better service.

 Upcoming enhancements to PLUS during February will include the ability to pull distros
on coversheets, and access to additional fields from the PLUS Interface.
In the fall, a new and final version of PLUS will be released. Version 5.6 will include
numerous breakouts, and data choice limiters.
A new SIGINT FEEDBACK form will be available sometime in 2005.
(U//FOUO) As you can see, PLUS is moving ahead with activities to support SID's
transformational efforts. For more information on PLUS, please contact the PLUS Team on
