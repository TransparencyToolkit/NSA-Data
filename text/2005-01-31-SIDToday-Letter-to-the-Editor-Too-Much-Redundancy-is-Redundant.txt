(U) Here's a comment on Friday's article Write Right: Too Much Redundancy is Redundant :
From: Anonymous
Comment: (U) Mr. Carlin recently appeared on a news program on MSNBC with Tim Russert. In
the interview he warned of "semantic creep" in writing and speech. "Semantic creep" is a term
coined by the late Senator Patrick Moynihan. Our organization, and our government is guilty of
this many times over and at the highest levels.
(U) "Semantic Creep" is when a softer, "nicer" expression is used to describe something in
terms not as jarring, or to slightly mislead. For example, in the past the term "shellshock" was
used, but over time and through other iterations we have now come to "Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder".
(U) Nowadays a "bomb" or "booby trap" is an "improvised explosive device". A "car bomb" is a
"vehicle-borne improvised explosive device". It might look a little less imposing on the page, but
it is still a bomb.
(U) Also, we see the term "leadership" used more and more when "management" would be more
appropriate. The two terms are related but are not always interchangeable.
(U) "Semantic creep" can be used to soften a description and make it a little easier for the
reader (or your listener) to handle. However it can also be used to slightly mislead or slightly
misrepresent and in the long run, be counterproductive.
(U) Thanks for a great article!!
