(U//FOUO) Accelerating Petal 1 of Transformation 2.0
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA, Signals Intelligence Director

(S) This is an important and exciting moment in our history. NSA is providing an unprecedented
variety of offensive and defensive services seamlessly to our customers and national security
partners. The global convergence of information networks and technologies coupled with the
compelling need to share information broadly challenge us to do even better. Our vision is to
"live on the net always, shape it sometimes, own the net as needed, and protect the net from
those who wish to do our nation harm." This calls for increasing the jointness of our operations
in many ways.
(U//FOUO) On 20 January, during another in the series of SID/IAD offsites, we discussed the
NSA/CSS landscape. We chartered a small team of leaders to think holistically about NSA
functions and to develop creative options for rapid movement toward a much more joint
operating posture. We expect the team to report out quickly and will then engage broadly within
our organizations to identify the best way forward in the interests of the Agency and our
customers.
(U//FOUO) The SID/IAD team's output will move us forward to develop the best approach to
accomplishing all of NSA's critical mission functions. We will map near and long term strategies
to solidify NSA's future as a key member of the US intelligence and defense communities.
Cheers, 
MG Quirk and Dan Wolf
