(U//FOUO) CIA-NSA Analysis Day
FROM: Carolyn S. Crooks
Customer Account Management, IC and Policy Pillar (S112)
Run Date: 02/23/2005

(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Directorate's Customer Gateway, working with Analysis and Production
and CIA's Directorate of Intelligence (DI), is hosting CIA - NSA Analysis Day on 16 March 2005
here at NSA. This event is the latest in a series of Customer Days being offered as part of the
SIGINT Directorate's Customer Engagement Strategy.
(U//FOUO) The primary focus is on intelligence analysis, both at NSA and CIA, and the need for
analytic collaboration between analysts at both agencies. The goal is to achieve greater
understanding and enhanced networking, teamwork, and collaboration among SID and DI
analysts, which will ultimately strengthen intelligence production for our nation's security.
(U//FOUO) The theme for the day is "CIA - NSA: Overcoming Intelligence Challenges through
Analytic Collaboration." The event will include a morning general session featuring key leaders
from both Agencies as well as afternoon breakout sessions on a wide range of specific topics.
Distinguished guests include:
John Kringen, Deputy Director for Intelligence;
Carmen Medina, Associate Deputy Director for Intelligence; and
Peter Clement, Associate Deputy Director for Intelligence / Strategic Programs.
(U//FOUO) As the focus is on analysis, the NSA SIGINT Directorate's Analysis and Production
elements have played a key role in shaping this agenda, and many leaders and analysts from
A&P will be speaking during the morning and afternoon sessions. This is a major undertaking for
SID and is itself a great example of collaboration with the Directorate of Intelligence, CIA, which
has contributed heavily to the planning of this event. We expect a great payoff to our national
missions by bringing together the analytic workforces of SID and CIA/DI in this unique forum.
(U//FOUO) Information, including an agenda and registration instructions, is available on the
web at " cia-nsa day ." The event is open to all Blue Badge and Military Gold Badge holders.
Registration is on a first-come basis and continues through 11 March. POCs for this event are
