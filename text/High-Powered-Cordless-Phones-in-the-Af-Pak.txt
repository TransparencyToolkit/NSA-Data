(S//SI) High Powered Cordless Phones in the Af/Pak Border Area: Is
UBL Talking?

FROM:

(C//SI) Do you ever feel like maybe you are missing some of your target's communications? Do
your targets operate in remote areas? Are your targets involved in illicit activities? If so, then
your targets might be using High Powered Cordless Phones (HPCP). HPCP networks are made up
of a base station and a given number of handsets, and can be found anywhere. They are
particularly common in rural areas with no infrastructure, and can be used as a standalone
network (sometimes called a "poor man's cell phone") or can be connected to any number of
devices that allow users to place international calls that would not be possible otherwise. HPCP
devices operate much like your cordless phone at home, with one major difference: imagine
getting in your car and using your cordless phone 50 miles away from your house!

(S//SI) The Afghanistan/Pakistan border region is the suspected location of Usama bin Laden
and his associates, but we think that we are missing some of their communications. The
Counterterrorism Product Line (CT) is currently developing HPCP networks operating in the
Afghanistan/Pakistan border areas in hopes of filling this intelligence gap. Thousands of
networks are operating along the Af/Pak border region, particularly in regions of known terrorist
activity such as the tribal areas of Pakistan. These networks are being documented in an
Agency-wide database so that analysts across the enterprise can share their findings.

(C//SI) Offices across the Agency as well as 2nd Party Partners and field elements are all
contributing to the HPCP effort. HPCP metadata for a number of countries is currently available
via the HOMEBASE data mart. Your targets might already be there!

(S//SI) If you would like to learn more, the HPCP Analysis Center (HAC) is sponsoring a
conference from 27-31 October 2003 . (Note from SIGINT Communications: see the related
article in today's SIDtoday for further details.) For further information on CT's development of
HPCP, please check out our website .
