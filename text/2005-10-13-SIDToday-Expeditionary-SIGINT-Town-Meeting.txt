(U//FOUO) Expeditionary SIGINT Town Meeting
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 10/13/2005

(U) Please join me in the Friedman Auditorium for a SID Town Meeting on the subject of
Expeditionary SIGINT on 19 October, 0800-1000.
(U//FOUO) SID will deploy more than 300 people to crisis areas of the world this year in support
of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The skill sets they represent will encompass everything
from Executive Staff Officers to Intelligence Analysts to Collection Managers to Forensics
Analysts. All of our people, wherever they're deployed and in whatever capacity they're working,
consistently receive high praise for the work they do in support of our nation's warfighters.
(U//FOUO) The purpose of this Expeditionary SIGINT Town Meeting is to underscore the
importance that I personally place on these important positions, and to ask your help in keeping
these positions filled. You'll have the opportunity to hear from your colleagues who have
supported our nation's highest priorities in Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Horn of Africa. They've come
home grateful for having been given the opportunity to deploy. In many cases, the SIGINT they
provided saved lives-- it made a difference. This Town Meeting will be your opportunity to ask
questions about deployments: where people go, what financial incentives exist, what living
conditions are like, and so forth. An additional informal information session will follow the Town
Meeting in 2N006.
(U//FOUO) Whether you are civilian or military (active and reserve), we need your help to
maintain a strong SIGINT presence in theater. Not only are the benefits remarkable, but the
experience you receive, the overseas family you create, and the national service you provide are
priceless.
(U//FOUO) For information on deploying to CSGs/CSTs, please call the Expeditionary Group at
 or "go NIST." For information on all other SID deployment opportunities, please
contact 
 at 
 For information concerning civilian pay benefits, please
contact the NSA Deployment Center at
. For more information on everything, come to
my Town Meeting on 19 October.
(U) This session will be broadcast and gray phone bridged to the field; SIGINT Communications
will publish details next week.
(U) I look forward to seeing you on the 19th.
