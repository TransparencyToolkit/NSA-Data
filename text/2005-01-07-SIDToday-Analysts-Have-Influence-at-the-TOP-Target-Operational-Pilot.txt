FROM:
Trailblazer Mission Element (S21T)
Run Date: 01/07/2005

(U//FOUO) Since the inception of the Target Operational Pilot, the TOP and its analytic
partnerships have successfully driven architectural requirements, recommended potential
technical solutions and delivered incremental capability to the analysts. Analysts are encouraged
to identify challenges and then participate in their solution by using TOP prototypes in SIGINT
operations.
(U//FOUO) These partnerships create advanced capabilities and functions for analysts and
partners in the Intelligence Community. The TOP provides a unique setting where analysts can
develop and test ideas, and then have them quickly employed as possible enterprise solutions.
(U//FOUO) There is always room at the TOP for innovative SID analysts who want to help find
solutions or identify areas they would most like to influence on behalf of their fellow analysts. If
you have ideas you want to share, technologies you want to test, or analyst processes that you
wish to transform, then the TOP is a great place to start!
