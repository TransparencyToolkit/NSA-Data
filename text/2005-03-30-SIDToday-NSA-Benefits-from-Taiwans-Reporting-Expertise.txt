Taiwan supplying NSA with in-depth, long-term analysis on the PRC (TS//SI)
(TS//SI) As NSA analysts working the Chinese military problem will tell you, getting a handle on
the rapid modernization of the world's largest army is a daunting task. Fortunately, NSA
analysts now have a new and significant tool in their SIGINT toolbox to aid them -- courtesy of
Third Party partner Taiwan.
(TS//SI) For years, Taiwan's 
 has been a reliable
producer of "one-off" activity reports on the PRC military. In the wake of the November "Joint
Analytic Conference" at KRSOC* and a December 2004 visit to NSA by 
 committed to begin providing NSA with term/trend analysis reporting
on the People's Liberation Army (PLA). During the first two months of the year, 
 has made
good on this commitment by providing over 50 term/analytic reports that run the gamut
of PRC military issues. Several reports have been turned around to NSA customers,
generating much response.
(TS//SI) It is also interesting to note that, while 
 reporting
practices is intended to improve satisfaction of 
 customers' requirements, it also represents
a culture change. The analytic reports do not contain Signals Related Information (SRI) and thus
give greater protection to sources and methods while providing customers with the full benefit of
 impressive analytic expertise. Furthermore, because of her efforts of recent years to
familiarize Taiwan SIGINT reporters with NSA's reporting philosophy, SID's 
 shares credit for this unfolding success.
