(S) The New Breed of SIGINT Reporting
FROM: 
D/Chief, Field Operations Office, Special Collection Service (F61)
Run Date: 10/25/2005

(S//SI) New type of reporting -- FIRs -- now being issued at SCS sites around the world...
(S) Information sharing, transformation, collaboration - these are not just words, but concepts
that NSA and Intelligence Community leadership have put into action. In January 2005, SID
today told you about a success that mixes all of these -- the launch of First Instance Reporting
(FIR) at Special Collection Service (SCS) sites -- and I would like to update you on its progress.
(S//SI) This new breed of reporting, primarily intended to support local requirements, is often
brief and event-driven. FIRs are now being disseminated to the same broad customer sets
served by A&P Production Centers, thus complementing in-depth reporting done at NSAW and at
the Cryptologic Centers. Certain caveats and classifications that restricted handling in a previous
reporting vehicle (i.e. Local Support Reports) were modified to make this wider dissemination
possible. The FIR also allows forward-deployed SIGINTers to push information out much earlier
in the production cycle.
(S//SI) Roughly half of all SCS sites are already publishing FIRs, and more are beginning
every day with the help of product line analysts who provide reporting masks, help package
requirements, and give advice on issues unique to their areas of responsibility. To-date, analysts
at SCS field sites have issued some 3,300 FIRs, covering a myriad of topics. Here are just a few
examples:
(TS//SI//REL) Two products concerning the inspection of uranium processing activities in
Iran were briefed to President Bush, who gave explicit instructions that they be passed to
the Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
(TS//SI//REL) A FIR revealed Russian government knowledge of a terrorist plot to attack
a nuclear site.
(TS//SI//REL) A report detailed the arrest of Taliban members in Nigeria believed to have
"terrorist tendencies."
(TS//SI) Finally, a FIR dealt with the location, facilitators, and transit routes of Uzbek
foreign fighters in Pakistan.
(U//FOUO) This initiative, and the collaboration it entailed, is a model for future endeavors. Its
continued success will be realized through ongoing collaboration and the cultivation of analytic
relationships across the extended enterprise, to include our Second Party partners. To those who
have already participated in this initiative, and to those who may be involved in the future, we
say thank you for your contributions! You are truly riding the crest of the transformational wave!
