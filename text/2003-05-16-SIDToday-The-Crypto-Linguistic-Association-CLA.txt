These<br>activities include a speaker series, an annual banquet with a<br>nationally recognized speaker, an ever-growing foreign film library,<br>a soon-to-be lending library of foreign "books on tape", and a<br>foreign language film festival. This year's festival included films in<br>Arabic and French, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi/Punjabi, Japanese,<br>Korean, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, and Spanish.<br>(U//FOUO) Presentations in our speaker series have featured topics<br>of interest driven by our members. These include Compensation<br>Reform for Language Analysts, Preparing Resumes, Tips on Taking<br>PQE's, the New Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT V) as a<br>replacement for the PQE I, and the new Language Analyst<br>Professional Health Program. CLA presents two annual awards: the<br>prestigious Sydney Jaffe Award for civilians and the CAPT Joseph<br>Rochefort Award for military personnel. These awards honor<br>language professionals whose outstanding mission<br>accomplishments reflect the tradition of leadership, ingenuity and<br>scholarship exemplified by Dr. Jaffe and CAPT Rochefort.<br>(U//FOUO) CLA partners with the NSA/CSS Language Analysis Skill<br>Community through a formal Cooperative Research and<br>Development Agreement in order to engage and involve as many<br>language analysts in as many relevant activities as possible. CLA<br>partners annually in the fall with the NSA/CSS Senior Language<br>Authority to sponsor Language Week. The goal of Language Week<br>is to highlight the importance of cryptologic language work, to<br>familiarize non-language professionals with the language world,<br>and to enable sharing and exchange among language analysts.<br>Last year's theme was "One Year After 9/11: How Language<br>Analysis Work Has Changed". Highlights included a kick-off town<br>meeting with DIRNSA, SID Director, and Director Analysis &amp;<br>Production, an overview of national-level language needs, language<br>initiatives from the perspective of the Intelligence Community, a<br>session on "Getting to Level-3/3", a luncheon with the Director of<br>the Klingon Institute, daily one-hour mini-language seminars and<br>technology demos, and a large-scale book swap.<br>(U) We enthusiastically welcome language analysts who would like<br>to become a member of the 200-strong CLA.
