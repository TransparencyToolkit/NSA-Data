DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Media Leaks - Part I (repost)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Run Date: 12/31/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Note: The two-part "Media Leaks" series ran originally on July 28 and 29.<br>(U) Have you ever watched television news and heard a report that started out something like<br>this: "Today, reliable sources revealed that U.S. intelligence has intercepted communications<br>indicating that..."? You may have thought to yourself, "How in the world is this information<br>getting out?" If so, you are not alone!<br>(U//FOUO) SID has a special office that tracks disclosures of this kind: the SID/Intelligence<br>Security Issues office (S02L3) . They are responsible for monitoring so-called Cryptologic<br>Insecurities (CI), which occur when "cryptologic material or information is put in jeopardy or<br>when sensitive information is disclosed through espionage or by unauthorized disclosure." Often,<br>this means media leaks.<br>(U) Media Leaks<br>(TS//SI) Let's take a look at some examples of damaging media leaks and the unfortunate<br>consequences:<br>-- (TS//SI) Media leaks from 2000-2002 disclosed that we were collecting SIGINT against<br>Usama bin Laden and al-Qaeda operatives:<br>(TS//SI) A CBS News report from September 2002 stated "The National Security Agency,<br>which monitors communications worldwide, intercepted a phone call from one of UBL's<br>operatives in Afghanistan to a phone number in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia,"<br>revealing NSA sources and methods as well as the extent of our capabilities against our<br>adversaries. <br>Damage assessment : al-Qaeda immediately employed improved security measures and<br>deceptive tactics to limit our SIGINT collection. Such disclosures prove time and time and<br>again that our adversaries initiate active Denial and Deception tactics to thwart our<br>capabilities. <br>Follow-on action : NSA's Office of General Counsel issued a formal report to the U.S.<br>Department of Justice of the unauthorized disclosure of COMINT information and<br>requested a follow-on FBI investigation. The unauthorized disclosure of COMINT<br>information represents a criminal violation and is subject to FBI investigation as such.<br>(TS//SI) A November 2002 New York Times Daily News article revealed specific<br>information regarding NSA geolocation capabilities during a very high-profile operation to<br>eliminate a known al-Qaeda terrorist operative. <br>Damage assessment : Such disclosures of NSA's role in these lethal operations hinder<br>NSA's capability to support the ongoing fight against global terrorism. The potential for<br>loss of lucrative source information increases astronomically.<br>(TS//SI) The Washington Times reported in October 2000 that SIGINT was targeting and<br>tracking terrorists suspected in the USS Cole bombing. <br>Damage assessment : Al-Qaeda initially heightened their security awareness and<br>practices, then in December 2001, the source went off the air, creating a significant<br>collection gap.<br>(U) ...but leaks are not limited to the topic of al-Qaeda:<br>-- (TS//SI) A December 2002 WorldNetDaily.com article, while it did not provide specific<br>classified information based on SIGINT product, did provide an accurate and unauthorized<br><br> </p>disclosure of NSA's capabilities. Specifically, the article indicated that NSA had lost its ability to<br>collect information on activities in Iran, thus disclosing a collection gap on a high-priority target<br>for the United States. The article was released shortly after we lost collection of Iranian<br>Intelligence Service communications. <br>Damage assessment : Vulnerabilities in our abilities against a high-interest target were<br>revealed. <br>Follow-on action : NSA's Office of General Counsel issued a formal report to the U.S.<br>Department of Justice of the unauthorized disclosure of COMINT information and requested a<br>follow-on FBI investigation. The unauthorized disclosure of COMINT information represents a<br>criminal violation and is subject to FBI investigation as such.<br>(U//FOUO) Coming in part two of this article: What happens when CIs are discovered, and what<br>is your role?<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
