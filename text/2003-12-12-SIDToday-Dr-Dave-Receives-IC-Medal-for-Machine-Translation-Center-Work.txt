The accompanying citation identified the CAMT<br>as a "center of excellence" and noted that "no other concentration of machine translation<br>expertise can match what is in the Center's office". It also pointed out that "the Center is<br>receiving more and more attention as agencies, unified commands, and laboratories search for<br>ways of dealing with large volumes of data".<br>(U//FOUO) Dr. Dave established the Center for Applied Machine Translation ("go camt") in the<br>late 90's to provide machine translation to the National Security Agency and to share NSA<br>translation technology with the Intelligence Community, the Department of Defense, the FBI,<br>and with Second and Third Party allies. It now provides translation into English from more than<br>60 foreign languages, of a quality at least adequate for scanning and filtering (triage). Its<br>premier product, CYBERTRANS, has provided over a third of a million translations since it was<br>put on line.<br>(U//FOUO) Asked to identify the key factors in his successful careers (he's had more than one)<br>here at NSA, Dr. Savignac responded, "Three things. First of all, for what I did I had to have<br>depth, I had to have continuity. Flitting from job to job wouldn't have cut it. Secondly -- in both<br>instances I inverted the usual NSA management structure. I took the technical lead, did<br>technical work, and delegated management responsibilities to real smart people junior to me in<br>grade. It worked out very, very well. Third -- accessability. My door is always open -- literally. If<br>I create the right atmosphere, folks just might feel comfortable enough to walk in and tell me<br>that they think I am going to make a mistake. That's one of the best things that can happen." As<br>for his future plans, he says, "I could have retired a couple years ago, but I'm still having fun. I<br>like the people I work with and I like having so many challenges at the Center. I like the support<br>I get from up above. So I guess I'll be hanging around for while longer. Besides, there's some<br>work I want to do with Kyrgyz ...".<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
