FROM:
Advanced Analysis Lab (S211A)
Run Date: 05/13/2005

It's time you signed up for this year's A&P Analysis Conference to connect with experts and
colleagues from around the globe. (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) "Keeping communications open and leveraging our partners' insights are important
aspects of our goal of operating as an agile, responsive, global cryptologic network." DIRgram413
(U//FOUO) The third annual A&P Analysis Conference aims to deepen the discussion on how we
do collaborative analysis in a distributed manner with partners across our global cryptologic
network. Join us here at NSAW (physically or virtually) 16-19 May 2005 as we crisscross
boundaries with officials and experts from NSA, Second Parties, private industry, the greater
Intelligence Community and military operations as they bring their ideas, concerns, and potential
solutions to the table.
(U//FOUO) These are demanding times to be in the intelligence business, especially as terrorists,
criminals, and other types of adversaries form and reform alliances, communicate
instantaneously, and try to hide among the noise. And what about us, how should our human
networks optimize for maximum effectiveness?
(TS//SI//REL) Watch the Analysis Conference video .
(U//FOUO) Come join the discussion as we explore this and other questions. General sessions
will be held in the Friedman auditorium in the mornings, 16-18 May, and on the afternoon of 19
May. Speakers include:
Senator Charles Robb -- Co-Chair of the WMD Commission -- will provide insights into
the Analysis portion of the Commission's report.
Dr. Lawrence Gershwin -- Chair of the DCI Foreign Denial and Deception Committee -will address how we are working hard analytic problems in an interagency context.
Dr. William Wood -- Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research -will present the perspective from the State Department.
James Surowiecki -- author of The Wisdom of Crowds -- will address why a group
collaborating outperforms elite individuals in solving problems, fostering innovation, and
even predicting the future.
Neil Garra -- CEO S2Company.com -- will address how war gaming can be used for
learning intelligence analysis skills in a team environment.
A high-powered panel will discuss how they use their human network and scenario
development strategies against difficult problems. The panelists include the founder of
eBay, one of the founders of "Wired Magazine," and a professor of management.
MG Stanley McChrystal, USA Commanding General, Joint Special Operations Command,
will make a special appearance from the warfront.
Acting Director of NSA, SIGINT Director, and the Deputy Director of Analysis and
Production will also weigh in on the importance of greater partnering in performing
intelligence analysis.

 (U//FOUO) Register now by typing "go analysis conference" or by going to
(U//FOUO) Smaller breakout sessions (some of which will be broadcast via VTC to the
cryptologic centers) will be held on the afternoons, 16-18 May, and on the morning of 19 May.
(U//FOUO) Remember that the 7th habit of highly effective people is to take time to "sharpen
the saw." The conference presents an excellent opportunity for analyst and manager alike to do
just that.
(U//FOUO) The conference is open to cleared NSA civilian and military affiliates, Second Party
colleagues, and contractors. Conference presentations will be at the TS//SI 5 EYES or below
classification and handling levels.
(U) "Concerted action with all of our partners is critical to maximizing our ability to perform our
mission. This is a must do, not a nice to have." DIRgram-413
