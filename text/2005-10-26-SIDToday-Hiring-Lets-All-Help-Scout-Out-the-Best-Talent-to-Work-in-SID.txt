(U) Hiring: Let's All Help Scout Out the Best Talent to Work in SID
FROM: Charlie Meals
SIGINT Deputy Director
Run Date: 10/26/2005

(U//FOUO) As you may know, we are at a stage in our history when we are hiring thousands of
people to come work in SID. This is a rare period when we are putting together the work force of
the future, and we need to go about this in the best possible way.
(U//FOUO) SIGINT-ers are a rare breed. They have skills in fields such as linguistics, data
acquisition, intelligence analysis, and cryptology (to name just a few) that only a small fraction
of the general population possesses... and beyond that, NSAers must be trustworthy and
talented. Finding such people is no easy feat! That's why I am asking every SID employee to
help NSA/CSS identify and hire the kind of people we need on our team to carry out our SIGINT
mission.
(U//FOUO) Is one of your colleagues transitioning out of the military? Think of him or her as a
potential hire for an NSA/CSS civilian job. Or have you come across others, young or old, who
can make a key contribution? If so, consider submitting an employee referral. Talent can come in
any age, shape or form, so let's think creatively about where we can find such people. Not only
will you be helping SID become even better than it is today, but there might even be some
monetary incentive in it for you personally. For example, NSA is offering a $1000 award for all
referrals that result in the hire of a language analyst:

(U//FOUO) We've said it many times: ultimately, it all comes down to people. Today we are
hiring the people you will work with tomorrow and for many years to come. Let's bring in the
very best!
