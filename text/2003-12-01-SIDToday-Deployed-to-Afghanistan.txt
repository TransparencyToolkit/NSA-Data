DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Deployed to Afghanistan<br>FROM: Sgt <br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/01/2003<br><br>USMC<br><br>(S//SI) My name is Sgt <br> and I deployed to Bagram,<br>Afghanistan as part of a NIST . I am a MINSAP participant and this<br>deployment seemed to be a natural extension of the office I was<br>working prior to going out. Although I had been working the Iraq<br>target, the methods and points of contact within NSA were<br>something I was fairly comfortable with. <br> <br>Bagram, Afghanistan<br>(S) Upon my arrival in Bagram, I got off of a C-130 late in the<br>evening and it was pitch dark. There is a light discipline in effect<br>for Bagram and no exterior lights are allowed around the flight<br>line. I was guided around the base (with cautions to "stay on the<br>hardball, there are active mines everywhere") and was shown to<br>my tent.<br><br>(C) The NIST team members who were not on watch helped me<br>bring my gear into the tent. I passed out, exhausted, almost<br>immediately after getting settled in. When I awoke the next<br>morning and stumbled from my cot out into the morning light, I<br>gazed in wonder at my surroundings. I was in the middle of a tent<br>city that was ringed by snowcapped mountains. The sun was just<br>peeking over the mountain tops, illuminating a complete ecosystem<br>starting to bustle alive around me.<br>(S//SI) Once I settled into the routine, I quickly realized that we<br>were in for some odd hours. The three analysts switched off as<br>there were not enough terminals for more than one of us at any<br>one time. We were on 8 hour shifts, but whenever anything odd<br>came up, or we were working some kind of 'pet project', we often<br>stayed for many hours after shift. There was an extra terminal that<br>was reserved for the senior analyst who was not always there and<br>we would commandeer that machine for extra work. We were fed<br>by Brown and Root (the Army's civilian contracting company who is<br>the answer to malnutrition, scurvy, and an appetite), and had 2 hot<br>meals a day. That meant we were fed a hot breakfast and hot<br>dinner. As much as people like to complain about such things, the<br>food wasn't all that bad. Everywhere we went, we went armed. We<br>usually carried a 9mm pistol in a shoulder harness, but when we<br>took trips off base, we also carried M16 A2 service rifles and M4<br>rifles.<br>(S) We were often traveling to Kabul. We had to pick up new<br>analysts, occasionally go for analyst exchanges, and conduct escort<br>duty for the various trips undertaken by personnel from the rest of<br>the base. We also had the unique opportunity to travel to the<br>Salang Tunnel with the New Zealand detachment personnel. They<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

Dispatch from CSG<br>Baghdad<br><br> </p>were headed there, and we were afforded the opportunity to tag<br>along. It is supposed to be the highest tunnel in the world, and as<br>a piece of military history it is fascinating. It has been fought over<br>by the Taliban, Northern Alliance, Russians and most recently, the<br>U.S.. All along the route up the mountainsides there are burned<br>out tanks and troop carriers left behind during previous conflicts.<br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing the multi-national<br>team doing the reconstruction of the tunnel. It was amazing to<br>travel throughout the countryside. It is a very primitive and stark<br>landscape. It was beautiful in its own way.<br> <br>Salang Tunnel<br>(U) The biggest eye-opener I had was in observing how NSA<br>deploys its personnel. I have been deployed with the Marine Corps<br>in the past, and it is a very different experience. It was nice to<br>know I was going to an established site. I was excited by the<br>prospect of not having to bring the equipment in, clean it up, pack<br>it out and bring it home. <br><br>(U) As much as I missed my family and really wanted to see green<br>grass again, when I looked around Bagram that final morning prior<br>to flying out, I was kind of sad. If there's one thing my experiences<br>deploying around the world have taught me, it's that these trips<br>are ALL once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Each one is a unique and<br>exciting adventure.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
