(U//FOUO) Cryptologic Language Readiness and Mandatory
Language Training
FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 09/20/2005
(S) On 2 March 2004, I mandated that every civilian and military language analyst
in the Enterprise receive 4 - 8 weeks of language training by March 2006.* The
reasons for this mandate remain compelling:
The NSA/CSS requirement for cryptologic language work is Level 3/3 (general
professional performance level) 
Over 25% of our missions require language skills beyond Level 3 
Language development has a direct impact on cryptologic language readiness 
Our capabilities Language Readiness Index is 52%, with 80% representing manageable
risk
(U//FOUO) A recent snapshot of language training completed by all language analysts indicated
that approximately 30% of our language analysts have met the Significant Cryptologic
Language Training Event (SCLTE) requirement and only 50% have taken any language
training at all.
(U//FOUO) This message reiterates my commitment to improving our cryptologic language
readiness through language training and directs my leadership to ensure our language analysts
take advantage of the training opportunities offered by my mandate. I expect managers,
language advisors and technical leaders at all levels to engage actively in this critical initiative,
and I have directed the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority, Renee Meyer, to provide me
monthly updates of our progress from now on.
(U//FOUO) With the assistance of the Associate Directorate of Education and Training and the
SCE** Command Language Program offices, Enterprise language advisors will identify those
individuals who have not met the mandatory language training requirement and will recommend
options for them. These options include:
traditional platform courses,
web-based LANGNET modules,
vendor training, and
directed and independent studies programs for those who are at Level 3 or who are
unable to attend scheduled training.
(U//FOUO) Together, we must and will ensure that our cryptologic language analysts are fully
capable of protecting our country and our young men and women who have put their lives on
the line.
