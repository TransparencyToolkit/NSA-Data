(U) During your NSA career, have you ever found yourself in odd circumstances for
Thanksgiving? Perhaps you were tdy to some exotic land where the populace wouldn't know a
cranberry from a pumpkin?... Maybe a local family invited you to dinner?... Or were you
stationed at a military base when the Secretary of Defense flew in unexpectedly to share a
turkey dinner with the troops?... Working shift on Thanksgiving when something unusual
happened?
(U) If you have any good "NSA Thanksgiving" stories, please send them our way -- just a couple
of paragraphs explaining what happened. If we get enough anecdotes, we'll post them on SID
today . (Read what people sent in for Labor Day .) Send your story to 
 and
. We're hoping to hear from you!
