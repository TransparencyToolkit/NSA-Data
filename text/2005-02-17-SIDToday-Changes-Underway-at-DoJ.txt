(U) Changes Underway at DoJ
FROM: 
SID Representative to the DoJ (S112)
Run Date: 02/17/2005

Justice Dept. now sees countering terrorism as their top duty; interaction with NSA changing (U)
(U) Just like the rest of the world after 11 September 2001, the Department of Justice (DoJ)
also changed. Then-Attorney General (AG) John Ashcroft issued a memorandum that shifted the
Department's primary focus from " investigating and prosecuting past crimes to identifying
threats of future terrorist acts, preventing them from happening, and punishing would-be
perpetrators for their plans of terror." In other words, the emphasis had shifted from Prosecution
to Prevention . The AG's memo highlighted three major areas that underpin these efforts to
disrupt and prevent terrorist acts:
information sharing,
information analysis, and
coordination
(U) Sounds familiar, right? These areas either complement or mirror many of our own NSA/CSS
Transformation 2.0 activities.
(C) Attorney General preference also guides the type of support given to DoJ by the SID
External Representative (SID Rep). For example, Janet Reno preferred delivery of a daily
SIGINT briefing book, but John Ashcroft did not. With the confirmation of a new AG, DoJ
intelligence support preference and tasking to the SID Rep may soon change again.
(S//SI) As you would expect, functions for the SID Rep at DoJ, located in the Office of
Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR), have evolved to meet this changing customer focus. How?
By moving from traditional SIGINT Intelligence Analyst (IA) primary functions such as retrieving,
reviewing, and distributing daily SIGINT products, to a more representational role that is a
combination of ombudsman, problem solver, and facilitator. For example, the SID Rep is the
"connectivity point" in OIPR for both the NSA Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the
Counterterrorism (CT) FISA** Team (S2I04).
(U) IT Changes -- Faster Delivery of SIGINT Products/Services
(S//SI) Technology changes and better IT connectivity are giving DoJ a measure of SIGINT selfsufficiency. OIPR has had the ability for some time to pull NSA SIGINT product (plus other
Intelligence Community daily reports) via JWICS and Intelink. Now, DoJ Criminal Division (CRM)
is exploring similar capabilities -- JWICS is about to go operational in the Counterterrorism
Section, and other CRM Sections may come on-line in the future. These changes give DoJ the
ability to quickly tailor all SIGINT requests to particular Section interests, or to meet ad hoc
requirements or crises.
(U//FOUO) The true "constant" during all these changes - customer sets - mission focus leadership - is the delivery of NSA SIGINT support for DoJ through the SID Rep and Account
Manager partner in Customer Gateway.
(U) And now the editorial :
(U) The "SECRET" Stuff (Location, Location, Location)
(U) I wouldn't want this secret to get around, but D.C. is an awesome place to work, and the
DoJ location is an outstanding starting point for exploration. I can walk out the Constitution
Avenue exit, cross the street, and walk directly into the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.

 The end of the same block is home to a wildflower/butterfly garden with shady benches for a
spring lunchtime respite. Cross the street from the butterfly garden and you enter the National
Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden (don't groan) -- some of the sculptures are actually fun, and the
park is beautiful. The Sculpture Garden has a huge water fountain that becomes an ice rink
during winter. All this is less than three minutes from DoJ's front door. As they say, there are
many more stories in the city, but those will have to wait for another day.
(U) Oh, one more thing. When I come to work every morning, I get a brief glimpse of "what it's
all about." As the Orange Line Metro rounds the bend from Minnesota Avenue -- especially this
time of year when the sun is just over the horizon -- both the U. S. Capitol and the Washington
Monument briefly appear, gleaming in the sunlight.
