A<br>number of viewpoints and concerns have to be reconciled before the resolution can be passed<br>(ideally, in the U.S. view, before an Iraq Donors' Conference in Madrid late this month), and in<br>fact prospects for the draft seem darker than they did when it was initially introduced a month<br>ago. Then, public anti-resolution posturing by France and Germany seemed to be off-set by UN<br>Secretary General Annan's call upon the Security Council to work together on stabilizing Iraq.<br>(U//FOUO) Now, in spite of revisions to the draft, France and Germany continue to express their<br>displeasure - specifically regarding the timing of turning authority over to a provisional Iraqi<br>government -- and have been joined by SYG Annan, who will not put UN personnel at risk in<br>Iraq unless the UN is given charge of reconstruction.<br>(S//SI) SIGINT and State reporting have indicated that no UNSC member wants to go down in<br>history as the one that killed this resolution, and countries are likely to abstain rather than vote<br>it down. The real question, however, is not whether the draft resolution will get passed, but<br>whether it will make any difference in the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq (especially in<br>the case of a tepidly-endorsed UN mandate):<br>--(U//FOUO) Foreign troops problematic: Passage of the resolution could result in a modest<br>rise in the number of foreign troops sent to Iraq because it will provide some political cover to<br>those countries whose publics are hostile to the concept of participating in a U.S.-dominated<br>enterprise - or to those which do not customarily send forces abroad without specific UNSC<br>authorization. But there will not be a big influx of foreign troops into Iraq: some countries have<br>few troops to spare, while others will refuse to send troops into what they see as a hopeless<br>morass. Even those foreign troops that do arrive in Iraq may be more curse than blessing due to<br>linguistic and cultural divides, and their potential dependence upon the U.S. for everything from<br>equipment to intelligence support.<br>--(U//FOUO) Other people's money: Even before introduction of the resolution, a group of<br>potential state and non-state donors had scheduled a conference in Madrid later this month.<br>Many countries may find it more politically feasible to donate money than to send troops to Iraq,<br>but donors will be unlikely to provide more than pocket change relative to the astronomically<br>high ($20-30 billion for next year alone) level of need. By way of comparison, fifty donor<br>countries in January 2002 pulled together $1.5 billion for Afghanistan (with an additional $4<br>billion in pledges - much of which remains unpaid) - following a U.S.-led war that had<br>significantly greater international support.<br>--(U//FOUO) UN Mandate Does Not Equal Automatic Legitimacy: The UN has a long history<br>of conferring international legitimacy upon assorted interventions and occupations. In Iraq and<br>the wider Islamic world, however, many view the UN itself as the enemy: a U.S. front that<br>perpetrated a sanctions regime and assorted bombings that unleashed widespread death,<br>destruction, and suffering among the Iraqi people. And, the new resolution may be widely seen<br>as window-dressing for a botched Coalition effort, not as true international buy-in.<br>(U//FOUO) A successful resolution will ideally form a long-term basis for international<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">cooperation on Iraq, and as such it has the backing of top U.S. officials. In the short-run,<br>however, those who equate the resolution with a miracle cure for the Iraq situation are likely to<br>be profoundly disappointed.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
