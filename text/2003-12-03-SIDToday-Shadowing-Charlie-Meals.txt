I encourage anyone interested in seeing a "view from the top" to<br>consider signing up for the program. You won't regret it! But first a word of caution, make sure<br>you get a good night sleep the night before, you're in for a very full day!<br>(U//FOUO) The schedule that Mr. Meals keeps is quite grueling. Briefings, meetings, and<br>courtesy calls begin at 0730, don't end until 1800, and cover myriad topics. During my<br>experience, I gained new insights into a project I was already familiar with during one briefing,<br>was briefed on two prototype systems during another, learned about efforts to improve the<br>early/threat warning process at a field site, and even developed some appreciation of metrics<br>during a Corporate Metrics Review meeting.<br>(U//FOUO) But what impressed me most was how cohesively Major General Quirk, Charlie<br>Meals, and their staff work as a team. As an analyst, I came away with the feeling that, although<br>they're physically removed from the analytic shops, they have the rank and file civilian and<br>military workers in the forefront of their minds when they raise questions during a presentation<br>or make a decision. I now feel that they are more like coworkers, part of my "team". Their focus<br>is on enhancing and unencumbering the workplace as much as possible for the benefit of the<br>analysts, which leads to increased productivity and efficiency.<br>(U//FOUO) For example, during the corporate metrics meeting Mr. Meals mentioned the<br>prospect of an easy-to-use tool for analysts to seek and add product requirements to each<br>report. Mr. Meals' concern was that the tool not be just another instrument which analysts<br>would be forced to learn how to use. Rather, it had to be easy/transparent to use, or have<br>similar features incorporated in tools already in use and familiar to analysts.<br>(U//FOUO) Likewise, during a briefing on the possibility of deployment of equipment from one<br>field site to another, MG Quirk was primarily concerned about the impact of the transfer on the<br>people at the sites. He questioned if the transfer would be just a "band aid" to temporarily fix<br>the problem, or if it would provide a more permanent solution.<br>(U//FOUO) Collaboration and cooperation are alive and well at the top of the Signals Intelligence<br>Directorate, but you don't have to take my word for it - sign up to be a shadow and see for<br>yourself!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
