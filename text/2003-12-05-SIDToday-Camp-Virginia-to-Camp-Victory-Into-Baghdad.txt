Armed with a 9mm pistol and an M16 rifle that I<br>prayed I would never have to use, I rode the whole way in a fiveton truck, with easy access to thermite grenades that could be<br>used to destroy our classified cargo in the event of an ambush. We<br>passed many Iraqi civilians - some waving American flags, some<br>begging for food or trying to sell something, but most just<br>watching in apparent awe as our trucks and humvees passed. We<br>also saw numerous Iraqi tanks, rocket launchers, and personnel<br>carriers that had been destroyed by US troops and aircraft as they<br>advanced toward the capital city. Aside from frequent stops for<br>repairs and fuel, we had a fairly uneventful trip to Camp Victory,<br>Baghdad.<br>Convoy to Iraq<br><br> <br><br>(U//FOUO) Our new home was in one of Saddam's former palace<br>complexes located just east of Baghdad International Airport.<br>Unfortunately, other than the change of scenery and the<br>permanent structures in which we worked, this new facility offered<br>almost no advantages over our makeshift tent camp back in<br>Kuwait. We ate nothing but MREs for the six weeks we were in<br>Iraq, and many times we were rationed two MREs and two bottles<br>of water per day. When we first arrived I went almost two weeks<br>without a shower, and for several weeks our restroom was a small<br>tent surrounding six metal drums covered by plastic toilet seats<br>and separated by small sheets. At that point I was working nights<br>and trying to sleep during the day. This proved to be extremely<br>difficult since temperatures routinely reached 110 degrees and we<br>did not have any electricity in our tent for air conditioning or even<br>fans, so I found myself averaging about two or three hours of sleep<br>per day. We often heard explosions and saw tracer fire or smoke<br>coming from the direction of downtown Baghdad, but I felt<br>relatively safe inside of our heavily guarded compound. The<br>conditions gradually improved as more people settled into the<br>camp. Eventually the metal drums were replaced by porta-johns<br>and we found a clean water source for showers and a generator for<br>fans in the tent.<br> <br>One of Saddam's former palaces in Baghdad<br>(U//FOUO) I took advantage of any opportunity I had to leave<br>Camp Victory and experience as much of the country and the<br>culture as I could. Although this often occurred during the day<br>when I would normally be sleeping, I knew that if I didn't take full<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

Our excursions included Blackhawk<br>helicopter trips to the Tikrit and Mosul areas, a humvee ride out to<br>the Ramadi and Fallujah area with some of our CIA colleagues, and<br>several trips into downtown Baghdad; including visits to the parade<br>grounds, the republican guard palace, and the former Iraqi<br>Intelligence Service (IIS) headquarters to witness the debrief of an<br>informant.<br>Blackhawk helicopter tour<br><br> <br><br>(U//FOUO) My adventure in Iraq concluded in a somewhat<br>bittersweet manner in mid-June. On my last day in country, I<br>accompanied a group of army engineers to a school in eastern<br>Baghdad, where they were going to make some repairs to the<br>sewer system that served an elementary school. A large crowd<br>gathered and became a bit unruly. They then began hurling stones<br>at us, and suddenly we heard two rounds fired from the top of a<br>housing complex about one hundred yards away. No one was<br>injured, but it left me with a somber feeling as the C-17 departed<br>Baghdad en route to Rhein Main Germany. I had learned much<br>about my ability to cope with adverse situations. I was proud of the<br>work I had done, and I was happy to return home to my family and<br>girlfriend. But hundreds of thousands of Americans remain in<br>harm's way around the world, living in conditions far worse than<br>mine and in much greater danger than I ever was. Many US service<br>members have been away from their families for almost a year or<br>more, and some have no end in sight. More important than what I<br>learned about myself, my experience in the Middle East helped me<br>develop a deeper appreciation and respect for those who dedicate<br>their lives to fighting for our freedom.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
