(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce
another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe
these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are
interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities. A brief abstract of
planned presentation is below:
(TS//SI) Now in existence for one year, the Global Network Development Activity (GNDA) will
provide a brief overview of its activities, to include some accomplishments. The GNDA stood up
in July 2004 with the goal of closing the SIGDEV gap for cable accesses and cross-site SIGINT
Development. A place, not an organization, GNDA provides an environment for experimentation
in technique development and automation. Discussion will also include an outline of analytic
impediments in optimizing our cable access programs and some recommendations for closing
those gaps.
(U//FOUO) To register for one of these sessions , military and civilian employees can call
 or send an e-mail to the "mpgteam" alias. Please include the CRSK 1500 class
number, your Social Security Number and session preference.
