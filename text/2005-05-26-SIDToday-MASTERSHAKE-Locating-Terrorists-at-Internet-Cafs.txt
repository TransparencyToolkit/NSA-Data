Zeroing in on terrorists who use public internet terminals. (TS//SI)

(S//SI) During a recent TDY to Iraq, a group of SID leaders met with the Charge D'Affairs at the
embassy in Baghdad. As related by MG Quirk, the official "spent a lot of time with us, and was
very forthcoming with his needs." The first three priorities on his list were "Where is Zarqawi?",
"Where is Zarqawi?” and "Where is Zarqawi?" (See the article MGQ's Notes from the Field .1

(TS//SI) So what is SID doing to help locate terrorists in Iraq? One effort underway is a project
called MASTERSHAKE. MASTERSHAKE maintains detailed technical information, as well as
business-related information, for devices which provide connectivity to the public Internet. The
vast majority of Iraqi Internet cafes are connected to the public Internet via satellite dishes and
modems which use Digital Video Broadcast - Satellite (DVBS) technologies. As a product of the
way these connections are made, providers who operate these hubs and their services require
"rough" geolocation information for the installation of the modem. MASTERSHAKE targets the
entire business chain, from manufacturer to Internet cafe installation, to ascertain any and all
available data regarding this geolocation, the network connectivity of the modem, as well as the
actual physical location of the installation.

(TS//SI) That's not the only source for that information, though! MASTERSHAKE also fuses a
variety of data sources from across SID organizations and intelligence agencies to enrich its
knowledge of each particular installation. Additionally, Network Analysis Center (NAC) analysts
are using RAP's X-Kevscore system to develop more precise location information by studying the
entirety of the network environment being served by each of these modems.

(TS//SI) MASTERSHAKE enriches and maintains all of this technical and geolocation information
and uses a unique hardware identifier of the satellite modem, called the Media Access Control
(MAC) address, to provide target offices with its best knowledge of the actual physical
destination of each and every session in which they see identifiers relating to their target. In
some cases, MASTERSHAKE can locate the target to a particular seat within an Internet cafe.
Currently, MASTERSHAKE contains:

•	Technical detail on over 9,000 satellite modems in the Middle East and Africa, many
Iocat able to a particular city

•	Precise location information on over 400 Internet cafes

•	Seat-1 eve I identification for over 50 cafes

(TS//SI) The locational information is accessible locally, as well as provided to TRAFFICTHIEF, a
system that provides near real-time alerts to analysts and war fighters on the ground telling
them when and where high-value targets are active on the global net if detected via any SIGINT
access such as SCS , TAP . RFQ , SSQ , etc. (See related article .) This information is used by
local and regional analysts to inform forward deployed elements so that they can conduct
surveillance and rendition operations.

(TS//SI) To date, MASTERSHAKE has been a part of over 80 SIGINT-enabled operations which
have resulted in numerous arrests, and information from MASTERSHAKE contributes daily to
operations in Iraq. Here's one example: In late December 2004, counterterrorism target
"Hamzah" sent messages from a computer geolocated to a cafe in Ramadi, and the cafe was put
under SIGINT-enabled surveillance. On 15 January 2005, two counterterrorism targets went to
the internet cafe and began using "messenger" services. ATRAFFICTHIEFtipper — incorporating
MASTERSHAKE locational information — was issued,	the two men

were arrested.
