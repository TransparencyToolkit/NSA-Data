(U) RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY (U) PENETRATING

HARD TARGETS

(U) Project Description

(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The Penetrating Hard Targets Project
provides proof-of-concept technological solutions to enable:

• (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Breaking strong encryption.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project focuses on meeting those
customer requirements that will directly impact the end-to-end SIGINT
mission during the next decade and beyond. It provides advanced
knowledge of technology trends and opportunities to steer IT products
and standards in a SIGINT-friendly direction. This Project contains the
Penetrating Hard Targets Sub-Project.

(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

{...}

• (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Conduct basic research in quantum
physics and architecture/engineering studies to determine if, and
how, a cryptologically useful quantum computer can be built.



(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY
2013:

{...}

• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Demonstrate dynamical decoupling
and complete quantum control on two semiconductor qubits. A
qubit is the basic “building block” of a quantum computer. This
will enable initial scaling towards large systems in related and
follow-on efforts. [CCP_0127]

(U) RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
(U) OWNING THE NET
(U) Project Description

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) The Owning the Net (OTN) Project
provides the technological means for NSA/CSS to gain access to and
securely return high value target communications. By concentrating on
the means of communication, the network itself, and network links
rather than end systems, OTN research manipulates equipment
hardware and software to control an adversary's network. Research is
conducted at the Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences in
College Park, MD, and supports the evolving NSA/CSS internal
information infrastructure and the larger IC.



(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

{...}

• (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Continue research of quantum

communications technology to support the development of novel
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) attacks and assess the security
of new QKD system designs.
