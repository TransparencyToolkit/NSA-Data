(U) The Crypto-Linguistic Association
FROM: Anita H. Kulman
President, CLA
Run Date: 07/05/2005

(U) If you are a linguist, the Crypto-Linguistic Association (CLA)
may be for you! Created by NSA's Hall of Honor recipient Dr.
Sydney Jaffe in 1965, it is the only NSA-based learned
organization that supports the continuing development and
advancement of Agency language analysts. Its goal is to highlight
the importance of cryptologic language work, to familiarize nonlanguage professionals and managers with the language world, and
to enable sharing and exchange among language analysts. CLA
members engage in many language-related activities, including:
a speaker series,
an annual banquet with a nationally recognized speaker,
an ever-growing foreign film and books on tape lending
library,
an annual book swap, and
a foreign language film festivals.
(U) The CLA has a strong partnership with the NSA/CSS Foreign
Language Analysis Skill Community to involve as many language
analysts in as many relevant activities as possible.
((U//FOUO) This has been a big year for the CLA as we help
celebrate 2005 as the national Year of Languages. We are cosponsoring many activities with the Office of the Senior Language
Authority, including a number of guest speakers and participation
in Language Festivals at the Cryptologic Centers (NSA/CSS
Georgia, Texas and Hawaii). The CLA annual film festival activities
were expanded to include an "Underground Film Festival" held in
the R&E Building and a Mini-Film Fest at FANX2. The CLA annual
book swap in March 2005 also was expanded to include a
Networking Fair.
(U//FOUO) NSA employs some of the nation's finest linguists, and
CLA honors them with four annual awards , two for long-term
career and two for mid-term career achievements; one of each is
military and one civilian. These are the prestigious Sydney Jaffe
Award for civilians; the CAPT Joseph Rochefort Award for military
personnel; the Norman Wild Mid-Career Award for civilians and
Colonel Alva B. Lasswell Mid-Career Award for the military. All of
these awards honor language professionals whose outstanding
mission accomplishments reflect the tradition of leadership,
ingenuity, and scholarship exemplified by their namesakes. You can
see the names of the recipients on plaques on the wall near the
OPS2B entrance. (See this year's award winners .)
(U) We enthusiastically welcome language analysts and others who
would like to join the CLA. This is a chance to enhance your
language skills while networking with your skill community peers.
Last but not least, it's fun! Please subscribe to ess1362 or "go cla"
and contact one of our board of directors for further information -we'd be happy to hear from you!
