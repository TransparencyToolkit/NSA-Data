Course Overview for 7 June Presentation: "Narcotics as a Facilitator for Other Illicit Activity,
Including the Potential that Narcotics Activity Funds Terrorist Activities"
(C) Proceeds from the production and distribution of drugs continue to facilitate illicit activities -to include terrorism. This seminar will examine the narcotics trade's global influence in Europe,
the Middle East, Central Asia, South America, and Asia. In particular, we will examine how the
production and distribution of narcotics in these regions are used to finance terrorist operations,
support governmental corruption, and act as a destabilizing influence for these regions. Focus
areas will include:
the allegations that the perpetrators of the Madrid train bombings financed their
operations through the sale of drugs;
the destabilizing influence of the drug trade in Afghanistan and the region as well as the
potential source of revenue for Muslim extremists in Central Asia;
how the Middle East continues to act as a land bridge for the movement of narcotics;
the endemic regional corruption and instability in Latin America stemming from the drug
trade; and
how the drug trade in Asia is evolving which is changing the traditional dynamics in the
region.
