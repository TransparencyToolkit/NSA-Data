 suggests that it is more efficient to post things on the web. My response is... if

(U) DC6M2 responds:
(U//FOUO) There is an office, Corporate Web Solutions, DC6M2, that will design and host your
site in their Sitepro content management tool. Sitepro allows users to keep their content current
via a web interface without having to know html. Visit the DC6M2 web site for more details:
