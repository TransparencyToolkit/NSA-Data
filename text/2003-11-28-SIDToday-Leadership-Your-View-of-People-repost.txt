Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 11/28/2003<br><br>(U) Leadership is about working with people and it really starts with how you look at them - how<br>you judge their motivation and their basic qualities. It comes down to how do you take the<br>measure of a person. Effective leadership depends on getting this right, so listen up!<br>(U) Here's the first lesson: people are wonderful . They are, in general, good and true. They can<br>be trusted and will constantly amaze and surprise you with their imagination and capacity for<br>innovative thought. Shakespeare: "What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason. How<br>infinite in faculty! In form and movement how expressive and admirable. The beauty of the<br>world; the paragon of animals." Wow!<br>(U) First related revelation: this does not emanate from social background, education, or<br>ability to say "Down 'na ocean" correctly. It is the natural state of human kind. This trait<br>allows us to live in large clusters and cooperate and generally make giant leaps that we<br>could never make alone. Of course, this doesn't mean we aren't competitive. I saw riding<br>lawn mower races on TV last week. Jeesh! We'll race anything that moves! But we will<br>have rules and demand that they are adhered to even as we do our best to beat out the<br>other guy. It is a pretty good combination to have basic goodness and a competitive<br>spirit. Naturally, there needs to be balance in this (like so many things). When these get<br>out of balance, things do not go well. Leadership plays a role in keeping that balance for<br>the leader as well as the "led".<br>(U) Second lesson: people are not perfect . Yeah, I know this is not news, but why then do we<br>have so much trouble accepting people as imperfect and forgiving honest mistakes? The fact is<br>that, overall, people have a very low bit error rate. We make thousands of decisions every day<br>and put in tons of honest effort and rarely make many mistakes. Even when we do, there are<br>lots of external factors helping to share the blame. The really good news is that we are almost<br>always working in a team environment where one mistake can be easily made up for by the rest<br>of the team. The likelihood of the whole team all making a mistake simultaneously is just about<br>absolute zero. Even just two people teaming up bring the chances of a major screw up to<br>somewhere around nil.<br>(U) Second related revelation: we have to find a way to flexibly try out new ideas, and<br>team up to prevent the stinkers from having too much of an effect. By the way, making a<br>mistake is an active notion. Doing nothing is the only surefire way to avoid mistakes. I<br>like the concept of an engaged, active person trying out new ideas and occasionally<br>making a mistake, more than the potted plant that never makes one. Leaders create an<br>atmosphere where the active person constantly innovates safely. Leaders constantly<br>foster the notion of mutual support. Excellence is having a stake in someone else's<br>success.<br>(U) Third lesson: not all the people are doing well . Unlike Lake Wobegone where all the women<br>are strong, the men are good looking and the children are all above average, there are some<br>people who are not performing well. Yes, it really is true. The good news is that the ratio is not<br>too bad. My experience is that around 95% of the people are doing well and meet the standards<br>for performance and conduct. This is a very good thing. About half of the last 5% are not<br>performing well but don't know it. A leader can easily salvage these folks with mentoring,<br>honest feedback and corrective training. This also is a very good thing. Sad to say, however,<br>there remain a few percentage points of people who are not performing well and know it - and<br>some who actually are screwing up on purpose. A leader supports all the others by quickly and<br>professionally moving these people on to another career, somewhere else.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) Here's the last lesson: you work with and around the best people in the world - they have<br>courage, heart and compassion. Consider yourself lucky, cherish this idea and remember it is a<br>privilege to lead Americans with a mission like ours. As a leader you will necessarily have to<br>judge performance and behavior, but you need not judge your teammates as people - it has<br>already been established: they're the best.<br>(U) What is the foundation of your leadership? Do you think people are basically good? Why<br>would you want to lead? Can you really make a difference?<br>(U) Next part: Leaders Really Do Make a Difference<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
