WAGTAIL PCM collection system to be installed in Turkey; analysts will be able to task Syrian
numbers (S//SI)
(S//SI) The Technical Liaison Office (TLO, aka NCRTurk) in Turkey has been approved for and is
finalizing a new pulse code modulation (PCM) collection system, called WAGTAIL, for its Turkish
military partners. The system will be installed at a Turkish base where the Turks will collect a
Syrian PCM that contains a number of channels of high-interest to both the U.S. and Turkey.
(S//SI) The WAGTAIL system is currently being assembled and integrated at the European
Technical Center in Germany and, once completed, will be staged at the Turkish headquarters
facility for testing and extensive training of the operators. Support for the training is being
provided by both our National Cryptologic School resources at Ft. Meade and by NSA
contractors.
(S//SI) So - what's in it for us, you might ask? During a survey of this PCM, these channels were
found to contain faxes and calls from Syrian Intelligence, the Ansar Al Islam terrorist
organization, several Iraqi and Syrian mujaheddin numbers, and even the Sy Al Shaab Royal
Palace. Using the analytical tools that WAGTAIL promises, NSA analysts hope to link these
known numbers to previously unknown sources of foreign intelligence service and terroristrelated intelligence. The collection will be forwarded back to the Turkish HQ and to the TLO (for
NSA analyst access), and the system can be tasked for numbers of interest from both locations.
(U) The implementation of this system serves as an excellent example of an all-hands effort that
enhances and bodes well for the future of the United States' oldest Third Party partnership.
