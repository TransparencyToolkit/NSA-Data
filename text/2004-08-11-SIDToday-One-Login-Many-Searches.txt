(U//FOUO) It seems that every month new tools are becoming available to allow SID analysts to
search easily through piles of information for the "nuggets" they need. In fact, one such tool
came on-line in June: the consolidated analytic metadata interface known as GLOBALREACH. Up
until now, analysts wanting to run a query on various SIGINT Development metadata sets
needed to log into each one separately. Now, GLOBALREACH allows them to login just once and
search across all of the TAC / TPS data sets for their target of interest.

(S) Analysts can still have the option of accessing just a single database, but GLOBALREACH can
save them the time and tedium of running the same query in multiple places. For example, if
analysts want to know everything related to their target's phone number, INMARSAT TIN, GSM
IMSI, or SMS address, all of this information can be gleaned with a single federated search. No
more thinking about what tool to use for accessing data! Instead, they can focus on how their
target is communicating regardless of mode.

(U) What data sets are available through GLOBALREACH?

•	FASCIA, ASSOCIATION, DISHFIRE, YACHTSHOP, SPOTBEAM, BROOMSTICK, MAINWAY,
ENTANGLER, GNDB, LAMPSHADE, OCTAVE, CONTRAOCTAVE and DISTANTFISH (coming
soon)

(U) What tools are available through GLOBALREACH?

•	BANYAN, DISHFIRE, YACHTSHOP, SPOTBEAM, ENTANGLER, GNDB and CONTRAOCTAVE

(S) Currently, GLOBALREACH allows searches on telephony metadata. Developers are also
working on the near term solution to provide federated queries against DNI* metadata (e.g.
email address) and plan to deliver this capability by September 2 0 04 — one part of the goal to
bridge telephony and DNI analysis. Providing one-stop access to TDS ( Target Development
Services. S2S3 ) tools is the first step in bringing these capabilities together. FASCIA and
ASSOCIATION are working to integrate DNI metadata - imagine the possibilities! Access to
other related tools and databases is also in our vision.

(S//SI) SIGDEV's TAC/TDS is a partner with Analysis & Production on the ASP Analytic Tools
Strategy (APATS) . a strategy to bridge analytic tools as a forerunner to RebA and TRAILBLAZER
deliveries. TDS is also working with its sister division, the Metadata Analysis Center, to forge
links with MAINWAY and the MAINWAY Entity Correlation database.
