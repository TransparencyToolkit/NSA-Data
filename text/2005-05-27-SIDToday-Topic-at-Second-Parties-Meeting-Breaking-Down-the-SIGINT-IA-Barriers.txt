(C) Topic at Second Parties Meeting: Breaking Down the SIGINT-IA
Barriers
FROM:
SUSLO-Canberra (F33)
Run Date: 05/27/2005

5-EYES reps compare notes on bringing SIGINT and Information Assurance (and HUMINT) closer
together (C)
(C) In March I arrived in Canberra, Australia, to fill the newly created position of NSA
Information Assurance Directorate Liaison and Integree. Within weeks of my arrival at DSD I had
the opportunity to see the interrelation of SID and IAD from a different perspective, by attending
the 2005 5-eyes ENIGMA meeting. The ENIGMA 5-eyes working group looks at the issue of
electronic attack (eA), specifically how to detect, investigate, respond to, and collaborate on eA.
The ENIGMA conference, the fifth in a series, was held in Canberra from 6 - 8 April, and was
represented by 13 agencies across the 5-eyes SIGINT/IA and HUMINT communities.
(U//FOUO) The U.S. delegation was led by 
 Deputy Chief, NSA Threat Operations
Center. She was joined by IA colleagues 
 and
and SID colleagues
 and James Penrose. Two CIA and six FBI representatives also attended the conference.
(C) The conference gave me a chance to see the similarities and differences between the various
countries' organizations. Of note was that every country is working to break down the barriers
between their SIGINT and Information Assurance organizations, despite the difficulties with
legalities and authorities. Surprisingly, each country also seemed to have similar issues with
respect to communication within and between their own organizations to include infrastructure,
policy and tradition.
(C ) Moreover, each is trying to foster better communication with their HUMINT organization.
The consensus seemed to be that it is easier for the cryptologic organizations to share
information among themselves than it is for the HUMINT agencies to share with each other,
because they lack the history of the UKUSA partnership. Overall, communication between the
various nations' cryptologic organizations seems to be good.
(U//FOUO) Coming from IAD (I333), this was a great opportunity for me to see SID-IAD
cooperation up close and to witness first-hand the success of this collaboration. NSA seems to
have already overcome many of the challenges with legalities and authorities with the blending
of the Information Operations mission.
(U//FOUO) For me, the conference was a valuable experience. I saw in action the significant
relationships NSA has with our 5-eyes partners, and initiated new personal relationships,
particularly with the New Zealand representatives. The meeting was well organized and the
Australians were gracious hosts. It appears that Australian agencies have more flexible funding
arrangements for hospitality; DSD and the Australian HUMINT agencies, the Australian Security
Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Australian Secret Information Service (ASIS), worked
together to provide abundant snacks, meals and beverages each day. Our Australian hosts went
the extra mile for their guests.
