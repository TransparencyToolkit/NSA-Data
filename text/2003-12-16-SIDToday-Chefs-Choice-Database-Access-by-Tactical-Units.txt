About a year ago, as we<br>geared up to support the approaching war in Iraq, SID made a commitment to provide tactical<br>elements involved in the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan with access to four national SIGINT<br>databases. Although we have fulfilled that pledge, the approval process has sometimes taken<br>longer than it needed to. MG Quirk believes that we should be able to provide a "yes" or "no"<br>response to database access requests within seven working days, and has laid out a process to<br>make that happen.<br>(U//FOUO) How will it work? The Customer Relationships and Analysis &amp; Production<br>organizations have set up a single process to handle such requests efficiently. The new process<br>is not another hoop for SIGINTers to jump through; rather, it simplifies the process by providing<br>a single point of entry (Customer Gateway's SIGINT Contact Center - SCC ) and making use of a<br>"template" to collect the necessary information. Although requests from tactical SIGINT units<br>drove the creation of the process - and the initial template reflects that - templates will be<br>designed to handle the special circumstances of other enterprise analytic activities, too.<br>(U//FOUO) The decision whether to grant the requested access will be made by whichever SID<br>Deputy Director has purview over the mission involved. (They are authorized to assign or<br>delegate new missions - and the associated database access - to both SIGINT producers and<br>certain other elements, such as Cryptologic Service Groups.) Last week, MG Quirk sent a<br>message to the SCE's (Service Cryptologic Elements) and NSA field sites to provide them with<br>details of how the new process works.<br>(U//FOUO) We want to expand this success and are presently looking at granting accesses<br>beyond the four databases promised in December 2002. We envision that other databases will<br>be considered, as appropriate for each delegated mission. As you can see, we are making strides<br>in implementing the Director's Transformation 2.0 strategy for greater sharing of information.<br>Watch for these efforts to continue in future!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
