This is what I told the other analyst deploying to NIST<br>Joint Task Force 20 (now 121) with me as we waited around Rhein<br>Main airbase for three days for a flight into Baghdad. He was a<br>very experienced analyst, one of the best we have at doing the<br>geospatial analysis that is the mainstay of NISTs. I don't know if<br>he believed me at the time, but after we had been there for a few<br>weeks, he told me that I was right.<br>(U//FOUO) I had realized in Kabul that to be a really good analyst<br>you have to know your customer - not just know where he is<br>located, or talk to him on the phone once a month. To sit down<br>with the people who will take action on your intelligence, whose<br>lives you are helping to protect, changes your perspective on our<br>business like nothing else I can imagine. My name is<br>, and I am an IA intern who deployed to Kabul and Baghdad<br>on NIST teams.<br>(S//SI) A year ago, I volunteered to go to Kabul, Afghanistan,<br>where I worked for four months with the High-Value Targets cell<br>comprising NSA, CIA, and DIA analysts, as well as military and CIA<br>operational elements. After a fabulous tour in Kabul, and with the<br>war in Iraq creating a large demand for NSA analysts in that<br>region, I eagerly accepted an offer to head to Baghdad for two<br>months in the summer.<br>(U) Everything on our little corner of the Baghdad International<br>Airport (BIAP) was tan. The sand, the tents, the HUMVEEs, the tee<br>shirts, the food. As far as I could see, there was just dust and tents<br>and concertina wire. At first glance, the only things that weren't<br>brown were the white boxes that were our porta-potties. Even<br>these were covered in so much dust and sand that they couldn't be<br>called white anymore. It truly looked like a wasteland. There were<br>no trees, no grass, no red cars, no yellow birds, nothing. All we<br>had was a blue sky and the flag flying above the compound.<br>(U//FOUO) When I first walked into the crumbling building which<br>served as the Joint Operations Command (JOC), I overheard<br>someone asking whether I was someone's daughter come to visit.<br>After four months at NIST Kabul, I was used to rough conditions,<br>long hours, and people looking at me funny when I told them that I<br>had volunteered to be there. I knew that there wouldn't be many<br>other women working with me at TF-20, the elite command of allmale Special Operations soldiers tasked with prosecuting HighValue Targets in Iraq.<br>(U) For the first few days, as in Kabul, everyone hid their stacks of<br>"men's magazines" and painfully avoided telling off-color jokes for<br>fear of an EEO lawsuit. But when people asked me why I was there,<br>I answered, "for the same reason you are." After a short while,<br>they realized that this was true.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.
