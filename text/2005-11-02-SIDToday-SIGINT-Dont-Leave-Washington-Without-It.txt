(U) SIGINT: Don't Leave Washington Without It
FROM: SIGINT Communications and Penny Horgan, NCR State (F1A)
Unknown
Run Date: 11/02/2005

(S//SI) An Ambassador finds out what SIGINT can do for him...
(S//SI) "You people at NSA are becoming my new best friends!" were the words of U.S.
Ambassador-designate to the European Union (EU) in Brussels, Ambassador C. Boyden Gray
(pictured). NSA regularly conducts business with senior diplomats; the visit with Ambassador
Gray, described below, is typical of that relationship.
(S//SI) As noted in a July "NSA Daily" article ("Preparing U.S. Ambassadors for New Posts,")
U.S. ambassadors due to rotate to new posts like to first interact with SID and IAD
organizations, and, when applicable, the Special Collection Service, to gain background on their
new areas of interest. Ambassador Gray met with NSA personnel, on and off campus, on two
occasions and is planning a third visit before he leaves for post:
(S//SI) On 28 September, he met with SID managers and analysts at NSA, as well as
with foreign affairs experts in FAD ;
(S//SI) On 5 October, the Ambassador and SID personnel went to the State Department
and discussed some of the biggest issues facing the EU; and
(S//SI) He is scheduled to meet with NSA/CSS Representative (NCR) State regarding the
support he seeks from NSA.
(U//FOUO) Time spent with the Ambassador was deemed productive by all parties (especially by
him); here are highlights of the Ambassador's visits:
(S//SI) The Ambassador was shown examples of agriculture-related, diplomatic, and
economic and trade-related SIGINT reporting from EU member states that could be
provided to support his new mission. Upon seeing the latter type, he declared: "This is
great;" "this is fabulous;" "I had no idea I would receive such detailed
information."
(S//SI) He was briefed on reporting classifications, caveats, and reporting formats and
was apprised of the process by which he will receive SIGINT product within the Embassy,
via the Chief of Station (COS).
(S//SI) He was apprised of NSA's capabilities and limitations in collecting
communications in Europe.
(S//SI) The Ambassador learned how to request information via information needs (INs),
being sure to include his preferred level of detail in order to help NSA tailor reporting to
meet his needs. In this regard, the Ambassador was advised to consult with the COS if
modifications had to be made to the INs.
(S//SI) The Ambassador gained insights into the EU personalities with whom he will be
negotiating.
(S//SI) FAD summarized for the Ambassador that NSA partnerships with EU member states are
based on exchanges regarding intelligence, technology, and information assurance.
