Accuracy

(TS//SI//REL) In an Enterprise-wide collaboration effort, Menwith Hill Station's New Mission
Development Center (NMDC) developed an innovative method for locating large numbers of
INMARSAT terminals in a very short period of time. The effort, named SANDGOAT, combines
national and FORNSAT data to produce locational information against 
 in a particular geographic region.
(TS//SI//REL) The results are astounding. Previously, it took up to 
 to locate
INMARSAT terminals, but with SANDGOAT, the time has been reduced to 
.
Moreover, 
 more locations are possible with SANDGOAT than with the existing
cross-mission location system for INMARSAT. The accuracy has also improved, with the circular
error of probability (CEP) 
 for 50% of the locations.
