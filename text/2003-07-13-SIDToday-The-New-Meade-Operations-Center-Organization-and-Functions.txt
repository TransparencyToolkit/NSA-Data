In this environment, the ARC provides the on-the-job training needed to<br>certify the NIST teams in advance of their deployment. The MOC is teaming with the 704th<br>Army Technical Control and Analysis Element (ATCAE) and the 70th Intelligence Wing, Air Force<br>National Tactical Integration, to bolster the effectiveness of the ARC. In addition, the ARC will<br>support Task Force 20, and the NISTs in Afghanistan and Baghdad with first level metadata<br>analysis in order to focus collection, filter, and nominate voice content for exploitation.<br>(S) The HPCP Analysis Cell<br>(S//SI) Under the direction of SIGINT Strategy and Governance, the MOC on 27 May 2003 stood<br>up the HPCP (High-Powered Cordless Phone) Analysis Cell (HAC) to provide the community a<br>focal point for HPCP issues concerning collection, processing, dataflow, analysis and reporting.<br>The three main thrusts of the HAC are 1) documenting the Tactics Techniques and Procedures<br>for how to prosecute HPCP, using Syria as the test bed; 2) accepting and answering Requests for<br>Information (RFI) from the field; and 3) working dataflow issues with the ATCAE and MENA<br>SIGDEV to get ground sensor collection into the national databases. Also, under the sponsorship<br>of SIGINT Strategy and Governance (SSG) the MOC will host an HPCP Worldwide Conference in<br>the Fall.<br>(S) Special Access Cell<br>(TS//SI) Teaming with Special Source Operations (SSO), the Special Access Cell performs<br>environmental analysis of the global information infrastructure with a focus on international<br>communications to enable future access options. In addition, the MOC will validate and<br>characterize TELEX information from various sources and is responsible for minimizing USSID 18<br>violations, analyzing the TELEX bearers on a canal-by-canal basis, and ensuring that the<br>dictionary is effectively identifying the TELEX traffic. This activity has opened up new avenues of<br>collection previously unavailable to target offices at NSA.<br>(C) The SIGINT Development Division<br>(TS//SI) The SIGINT Development Division (SDD) is working with Corporate HF Services (CHS),<br>in direct response to a requirement to survey the HF environment in the Konar Valley,<br>Afghanistan where Special Forces units have been compromised. CHS is installing an HF<br>wideband collection system (SUPERCODING) at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. The MOC will be<br>tasked to conduct search and survey of the HF environment to determine what communications<br>modes are in use.<br>(TS//SI) The SDD has teamed with the Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center (KRSOC) in<br>project Long Stare to identify unidentified signals emanating from North Korea. SDD was also<br>tasked by Cryptologic Exploitation Service (CES) to validate unidentified signals from North<br>Korea from overhead assets.<br>(S//SI) Additionally, the SDD is <br>, and is conducting HF search and survey looking for United Nations (UN) and NonGovernmental Organizations (NGO) in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and Liberia with a<br>focus toward force protection.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) Collection Development Cell<br>(S//SI) A new project for the SDD is to create an increased focus on training with regard to<br>signals development, search, and analysis. In the Collection Development Cell (CDC), the MOC is<br>teaming some of the most experienced collectors with, in some cases, new collection personnel<br>to provide intense on-the-job training on the wide variety of collection equipment and signals<br>processors available in the SDD. This effort complements the ever-increasing role in HF Signals<br>Development, and helps overcome a shortage of highly qualified personnel.<br>(C) Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell<br>(S//SI) The Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell (TREC) is the newest growth area for the MOC. The<br>TREC will incorporate all the accesses available to document the tactical radio environment into<br>a centralized and focused database. This longstanding requirement from SID will finally be<br>realized in the MOC.<br>(U) Additional Activities<br>(S//SI) Expanding on its current role as a test bed for new capabilities, the Director envisions<br>the MOC as a developmental platform for tactics, techniques, procedures, tools, systems, and<br>ideas that can then be exported to the Regional Security Operations Centers or the Mission<br>Ground Stations. This transformation of the MOC's mission will allow it to more effectively<br>support the SCEs' need to transform the skills of their workforce to deal with current and future<br>technologies, by providing a training and operational environment that is suitable for skills<br>development.<br>(S//SI) Internally, the MOC has reorganized its structure to mirror that of field stations, with an<br>Operations and a Support element. It has moved to a common shift scheduled to promote unit<br>cohesiveness, and has established analysis and training organizations to support its new<br>missions. The MOC is well on its way to establishing itself as a valuable component of the<br>Agency's SIGDEV arsenal.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on our transition, please visit our website at "go moc."<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
