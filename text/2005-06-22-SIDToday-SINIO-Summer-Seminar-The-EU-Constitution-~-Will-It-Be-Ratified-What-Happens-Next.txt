What Happens Next?
FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 06/22/2005
(C) On Tuesday, 28 June 2005 the SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are
pleased to present the 4th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for the Summer
2005. "The EU Constitution ~ Will it be Ratified? What Happens Next?" will be presented by the
D/SINIO for Europe,
 on Tuesday, 28 June from 11:30 to 13:00 in room
2E099. Advance registration is required.
(C) Eligible SID students interested in attending this brown-bag session should enroll for class
number 7532 using Peoplesoft. Enrollment will be first come, first served. In case of difficulties
with Peoplesoft an email can be sent to Roland Recker (
) with the following
information, and include the course name (AREA 1500 -- "The EU Constitution ~ Will it be
Ratified? What Happens Next?"), your name, SSN and organization.
Course Overview:
(C) Several key countries in the European Union have opted to hold referenda on the EU
constitution this year, leaving the decision up to their general populations. Since all 25 countries
in the EU have to ratify the constitution, some referenda could go either way, and the EU has
not come up with a 'Plan B', the future could be rather confusing. What will happen inside the
EU and in its relations with the rest of the world should the Constitution not be ratified? Will the
EU muddle through and just apply certain aspects of the Constitution piecemeal, or will a serious
political crisis ensue?
