(U) A 'Golden' TDY
FROM: 
PAC's Focused Target Development (S2G31)
Run Date: 06/08/2005

An analyst jumps into CSG work with both feet (in more ways than one!) (U)
(S//SI) After being at NSA for over two years, I volunteered for a TDY to the Cryptologic
Services Group (CSG) at Central Command (CENTCOM) in Tampa. It turned out to be one of the
best experiences I've had while working at NSA.
(S//SI) I was selected to work Counterterrorism (CT) and the Al-Qa'ida Senior Leadership
(AQSL) mission in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border area. I also worked with forward-deployed
CT and CSG analysts on high value targets (HVT's) in Iraq. One such HVT was former regime
member Sabawi Ibrihim Al-Tikriti. Through call-chaining techniques, analysts were able to
recover previously unknown contacts, allowing NSA's Iraq shop to task and develop multiple new
numbers. The ensuing reports provided new information on Sabawi for the command.
(S//SI) Targets in Iraq and Afghanistan/Pakistan were tracked using call-chaining and networkdiagramming techniques with such tools as Banyan, Mainway, Association, Cultweave and
Arcview. The CSG performed daily Arcview pulls on AQSL communications in the
Afghanistan/Pakistan region to determine which HVT's were currently active, whom they
communicated with, and where they were located. Through coordination with NSA target offices,
locations of senior Taleban HVT's were discovered. This was put together with imagery from
CENTCOM NGA* analysts to create target packages for analysts forward deployed.
(S//SI) All-source analysis was also an integral part of tracking the targets. Using Intelink,
analysts accessed community-wide reporting including CIA HUMINT reports, DIA reports and
highly-valued NSA SIGINT products. Sitting within CENTCOM spaces, I was able to regularly
apply these NSA products to the big picture, resulting in a fused intelligence representation. This
all-source effort has been credited with the capture of multiple Taleban and AQSL supporters in
the Afghan/Pakistan border area.
(U//FOUO) On a lighter note, through networking with a few CT analysts, I was given a great
opportunity to skydive with the U.S. Army Golden Knights. The Golden Knights are an elite
parachute team that travels around the world demonstrating their talent and expertise in
competitions. This was my first time parachuting and I went tandem with a soldier who has
jumped with President George H.W.Bush and Chuck Norris.

(U//FOUO) I definitely recommend a TDY to CENTCOM to anyone who is interested in working in
a fast-paced environment and who wants to directly impact the mission overseas.
