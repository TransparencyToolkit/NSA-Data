(U) A&P Leaders Convene in Texas
FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis & Production (S2)
Run Date: 03/17/2005

Leadership conference held in Texas from 1-3 March (U)
(U//FOUO) Our time in San Antonio at NSA/CSS Texas was jam-packed and passed very quickly.
Two days were spent with the Executive Leadership Team** (ELT), with the primary goal of
ensuring we move forward in lock step as a team. We started the session with the "Analysis
Strikes Back" video to demonstrate our vision of how a net-centric enterprise will operate in the
future -- with collaboration and information sharing across the community.
(U//FOUO) We also talked about the critical role of governance and the need for everyone's
understanding of mission, roles and authorities. Mission Alignment discussions concerned not
only mission transfers, but also the critical role the enablers play in the process. We showed the
"Build-Out" video to get people thinking about the workspaces of the future. The MARSOC
PMO** has the lead in ensuring the enablers provide the necessary support along the way,
however, the MARSOC PMO needs our input to understand what the enablers must support in
the global enterprise -- and based on our requirements, the enablers will matrix their
organizations to address them.
(U//FOUO) The rest of the time was spent providing updates on key areas. Production Services
briefed on the A&P Configuration Management Process, Technology and the S2 budget. Each of
the centers -- Texas, Hawaii, Georgia and Colorado -- presented overviews of the status of their
transformation efforts. MRSOC presented their briefs on their vision of their role in Information
Operations (IO) and P2/P3** integration efforts. The briefings are available at:
 (click on Agenda/Briefings under 12 March 2005 -- the RSOC/DSOC briefings are under 2 March).
(U//FOUO) On Thursday, smaller groups toured NSA/CSS Texas. We attended their morning
meeting, getting an update on their current operations. That was followed by a Town Meeting
where we were able to share our vision and address their concerns. Key areas of interest were
infrastructure and the timing of mission transfers. We went on a floor tour and had a chance to
learn more details on their current missions and the status of ongoing transfers. We saw an
eager, knowledgeable and professional workforce -- excited about their role in the enterprise.
(U//FOUO) There are many moving parts -- the stand up of the Director of National Intelligence,
blending of SIGINT and Information Assurance, P2/P3 integration, Title 10/50** blending, new
leadership -- and of course, the continuing global war on terrorism and the myriad of other
critical targets. Change IS the only constant -- and we must embrace that concept, continue to
move forward, and be prepared to make course corrections as necessary. This is an exciting time
and a unique opportunity to influence the cryptologic system of the 21st century.
