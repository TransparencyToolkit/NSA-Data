(U//FOUO) This month's A&P Analytic Showcase will be on Friday, 17 June 2005 at 10001100 in room 9A135. There will be two briefings given by members of the Network Analysis
Center (NAC).
(C) The overall classification of the brefings is: 
TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL//20291123
Briefing #1:
Title: (TS) "Internet Cafe Geolocation Techniques"
Briefer: (U//FOUO)

, Global Network Analyst

Summary: (TS//SI) 
 briefing will cover Internet Cafe geolocation techniques that he and
fellow GNA Intern
 developed while in the Network Analysis Center. These
techniques include the correlation of technical network data from a variety of sources, the
identification of overlapping user populations among Internet Cafes to aid in geolocation, a
process to automatically correlate active and passive collection, and cross media analysis to
correlate geolocatable phone events to DNI. This derived information is fed into the
MASTERSHAKE VSAT modem database and the TRAFFICTHIEF tool to support SIGINT-enabled
surveillance and rendition operations in the Iraqi theater. Additionally, this briefing will cover
ongoing analysis and future directions. (See related article on MASTERSHAKE.)
Briefing #2:
Title: (TS) "Using THERAPYCHEATER to Create New Avenues of SIGINT"
Briefer: (U//FOUO)

 Global Network Analyst Intern

Summary: (TS//SI//REL) 
will be briefing on THERAPYCHEATER. This is a system that uses
metadata analysis to detect and exploit the communication patterns of targets about whom the
SIGINT system has no specific a priori knowledge. By identifying suspicious patterns in the
access to draft folders of webmail accounts, THERAPYCHEATER will identify email addresses
potentially being used in a form of covert communication known as a cyber dead drop. There are
numerous examples in both SIGINT and collateral of terrorists using cyber dead drops to
communicate operational information and plans.
(U//FOUO) The Analysis & Production Analytic Showcase normally provides a monthly forum for
the Analysis and Production Offices to share with the work force both the accomplishments and
obstacles impacting the NSA/CSS SIGINT mission. The intent is to focus on timely and current
events, ideas, products, successes, systemic issues and obstacles, or collaborative efforts that
are shaping, enabling, and impacting the Agency's mission to meet and satisfy our customers'
information needs.
(U//FOUO) This is your opportunity to learn more about what is going on in Analysis &
Production, so mark you calendars and plan to attend the Analytic Showcase on 17 June.
Although attendance is open to the entire Analysis & Production work force, these briefings are
extremely popular -- seating is limited and is available on a first-come, first-served
basis.
