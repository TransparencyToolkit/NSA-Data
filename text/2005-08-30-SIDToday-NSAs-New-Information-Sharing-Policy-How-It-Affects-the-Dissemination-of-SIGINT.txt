(U//FOUO) NSA's New Information Sharing Policy: How It Affects the
Dissemination of SIGINT
FROM: 
SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 08/30/2005

(U//FOUO) What NSA/CSS Policy 1-9 means to SIGINT analysts.
(U//FOUO) What is this "Information Sharing" business? Isn't that what NSA has been doing for
years? If you've heard talk in the halls or at meetings this summer about a new NSA policy on
Information Sharing and wondered what it means to you and others in the SIGINT Directorate,
keep on reading.
(U//FOUO) You may already know that the Acting Director signed NSA's new Information
Sharing Policy ( NSA/CSS Policy 1-9 ), on 26 May 2005. Policy 1-9 implements recent DNI and
other Executive Branch policies on information sharing, as well as Transformation 2.0, to enable
effective and efficient sharing between NSA/CSS and our partners, allies, and customers, which
in turn enhances the SIGINT and Information Assurance missions. Because today's cryptologic
information can be of value to our partners well before we have issued a traditional SIGINT
report, it is incumbent upon us to share appropriate information at the earliest point at which
the partner can understand and use the SIGINT in support of his mission.
(U//FOUO) Policy 1-9 provides for the broadest possible sharing of SIGINT (and
Information Assurance) information and, although the policy places special emphasis on the
sharing of terrorism-related information within the U.S. Government, it also applies to other
categories of information. While this policy fosters sharing to the maximum extent possible,
sharing must be consistent with existing statutes, executive orders, regulations, and the
authorities governing the protection of intelligence sources and methods, as well as the "needto-know" principle.
(U//FOUO) When one shares SIGINT information, one is disseminating SIGINT, so these
dissemination activities must be in accordance with Policy 1-9 and all other existing USSS
policies and directives, including USSID CR1611(P) , "SIGINT Dissemination for Analytic
Collaboration (Provisional)". The type of SIGINT information shared and the degree to which it
has been minimized and/or assessed for foreign intelligence determines eligibility for its receipt:
1.  SIGINT, in any form, that has been minimized and assessed for foreign intelligence is
eligible for sharing with:
any customer,
U.S. partner, or
foreign SIGINT partner.
2.  SIGINT metadata that has been minimized but not assessed for foreign intelligence is
eligible for sharing with:
any U.S. Intelligence Community partner or
foreign SIGINT partner.
3.  SIGINT information (metadata and content) that has not been minimized or assessed for
foreign intelligence is eligible for sharing only with:
NSA/CSS SIGINT elements,
foreign SIGINT partners, and
other U.S. Government elements that have been approved for SIGINT authorities.
(U//FOUO) Because there are specific minimization and dissemination procedures for Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)-derived SIGINT information (both content and metadata), be
sure to consult those additional guidelines before sharing any FISA-derived SIGINT information.

 (See FISA FAQ .)
(U//FOUO) Full and open sharing within legal and policy frameworks will drastically change the
way we do our SIGINT business but it will also make for better SIGINT, and therefore, better
intelligence for the nation. While a major cultural shift for us, we must still protect SIGINT
sources and methods as we share more and more SIGINT. That's why the policy states that the
SIGINT information is eligible for sharing. SIGINT analysts must decide whether the
information they have is appropriate for sharing.
(U//FOUO) To this end, a number of organizations -- SIGINT Policy, A&P Operations Staff,
SIGDEV, Information Sharing Services -- are now working hard together to devise the new
processes necessary to implement Policy 1-9 and to provide more detailed guidance as to what
information may be shared, with whom, and how best to share.
(U//FOUO) We recommend that you take a look at the new Information Sharing Policy 1-9 on
the NSAnet and begin thinking about how you can share appropriate SIGINT information. Be on
the lookout for additional guidance in the days and weeks ahead and if, in the meantime, you
have questions or suggestions about sharing information, please contact:
SIGINT Policy 
the A&P Operations Staff 
Information Sharing Services
