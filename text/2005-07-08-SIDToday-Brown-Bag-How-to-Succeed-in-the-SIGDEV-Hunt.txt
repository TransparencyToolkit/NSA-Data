(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce
another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe
these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are
interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(U//FOUO) This month's featured speakers are 
and 
from the SSG
staff, who will discuss Target Templating & Hypothesis Development: "How to Succeed in the
SIGDEV Hunt." Below is a brief description of their planned presentation:
(U//FOUO) Target Templating is NOT simply binning data into portions of the Nine-Layer Model.
Today, analysts create Target Threads to "drill down" into layers and map the best target-toaccess link. Success in templating is predicated on the development of appropriate and
measurable hypotheses that guide repeatable SIGDEV; define targets for the analytic hunt,
provide a framework for visualization and documentation, and enable analytic teams to establish
a common center of gravity for collaboration.
(U//FOUO) This session will take the audience on a tour of Hypothesis Development from the
analyst response to the Customer Need, to the Assessment of Knowledge Gaps and the creation
of a plausible Hypothesis in order to most appropriately utilize the Templating Process.
