(S)	A new tactical SIGINT producer will soon be up and running in Europe, On 10
March, MG^^^B(SID) and MG	of the Army's Intelligence and Security

Command (INSCOM) signed the Concept of Operations for the European Security

1 of 3

Center (ESC), setting the stage for an April start of formal SIGINT operations in
Darmstadt, Germany The ESC (USM-44) will perform SIGINT operations primarily
in support of U.S. Army Europe and the European Command, but it will also
conduct mutually beneficial, cooperative missions with various SID Product Lines,

(C) The ESC is a fixed site facility that will provide crisis support to military
operations throughout the European Command theater, which includes not only
Europe, but also much of Africa and parts of the Middle East, Working with a
collocated INSCOM Theater SIGINT Battalion (TSB), the ESC will also provide an
on-demand survey capability and deploy tailored front-end collection equipment. It
will be a complete production facility, performing collection, processing, analysis
and dissemination,

(C) The Center will also support theater SIGINT soldiers assigned at tactical
echelons. It will serve both as a formal training center where those soldiers
routinely train and maintain technical and language skills, and as a deployment
center for soldiers who directly support contingency missions and combat
operations,

(C) The ESC is initially staffed by SIGINT soldiers of INSCOM's 66th Military
Intelligence Group, augmented by Army civilians and contractors. In the near term,
they will be assisted by SID augmentees who possess critical skills, with the
appropriate level of long-term SID support to be assessed as the ESC matures.
Initially an "Army" organization, the ESC is a flexible construct that could
potentially host personnel and missions from other Services and Agencies,

(C) The ESC is housed in two new SCIF** structures (over 10,000 square feet)
adjacent to an existing Army Operations SCIF that houses other Army theater
intelligence support missions, allowing an enhanced all-source effort against
theater requirements. Current ESC systems and capabilities include 59 Distributed
Common Ground Station - Army (DCGS-A) workstations, HIGHCASTLE (for voice
processing and analysis and reporting), the TROJAN CLASSIC XXI collection,
processing, analysis and reporting system, and an Emitter Mapping suite. Planned
reconfiguration includes a ,‘Linguarium,l, a novel construct to consolidate, focus
and enhance voice analyst capabilities and productivity.
