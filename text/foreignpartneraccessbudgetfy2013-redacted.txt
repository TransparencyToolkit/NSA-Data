(U) Project Description

(U//FOUO) The Foreign Partner Access Project contains two major programs - RAMPART-A and
WINDSTOP.

(TS//SI//NF) The RAMPART-A program provides collection against long-haul international leased
communications through special access initiatives with world-wide SIGINT partnerships. RAMPART-A
employs TURMOIL capabilities, provided by the Net-Centric Capabilities (NCC) Project in the Mission
Processing & Exploitation Expenditure Center. Additional NCC efforts will address the processing challenges
of the volume, velocity, and variety of data present at the RAMPART-A sites. RAMPART-A has access to over
3 Terabits per second of data streaming world-wide and encompasses all communication technologies such as
voice, fax, telex, modem, e-mail internet chat, Virtual Private Network (VPN), Voice over IP (VoIP), and voice
call records.

(TS//SI//NF) The WINDSTOP program focuses on second party relationships. WINDSTOP currently partners
with all the second parties, but primarily the United Kingdom (UK), to develop a well-integrated, over-arching
architecture to utilize unprecedented access to communications into and out of Europe and the Middle East.
Collection capabilities include Digital Network Intelligence processing and selection capabilities for e-mail, web,
Internet chat, and VoIP.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) This Project supports the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity
Initiative (CNCI) by enhancing capabilities that identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities to US
communication systems. This Project contains the RAMPART-A Modernization, RAMPART-A Operations and
WINDSTOP Sub-Projects.

(U) Base resources in this project are used to:

•	(TS//SI//NF) Provide annual upgrades to system capabilities at existing Foreign Partner collection sites to
keep pace with the rapidly changing telecommunications field.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Provide access and collection against international high-priority target •

• (S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support continuing requirements of infrastructure and communications
improvements within the Foreign Partner collection sites to collect high speed Digital Network Intelligence,
voice, fax, telex, e-mail, internet chat, VPN, and VoIP communications.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support CNCI by ensuring that data stores are produced, common collection
system analytic techniques are developed, adequate infrastructure is built for increased processing, and
enhanced collection tasks in support of cyber defense are implemented to meet the operational needs
and satisfy agreements for collection and processing at selected Foreign Partner collection sites using
TURMOIL collection systems.

(U) There are no new activities in this Project for FY 2013.

(U) OCO resources in this project are used to:

•	(TS//SI//NF) Provide contracted services and equipment for upgrades on a processing suite at a
RAMPART-A site. The upgrade will exploit the latest technologies present in

networks and consists of the design, procurement, integration, testing and deployment of advanced
processing capabilities hosted on the latest server technologies.

(U) The CCP expects this Project to accomplish the following in FY 2013:

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Expand collection and processing capabilities resulting from joint
collaboration efforts and shared access initiatives to leverage the highly lucrative NSA/CSS Second Party
access and to exploit high speed Digital Network Intelligence.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY ) Complete the deployment of NCC Increment 2 and 3 defensive software
applications in support of the CNCI interconnected network of sensors.

•	(S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Support and expand the TURMOIL-based foreign site processing systems
in order to exploit high-speed Digital Network Intelligence. Support the continuing requirements of
infrastructure and communications improvements to RAMPART-A and WINDSTOP that will provide
exploitation of high speed Digital Network Intelligence.

•	(TS//SI//NF) Integrate Third Party releasable Dialed Number Recognition and Digital Network Intelligence
collection systems upgrades, developed by NSA/CSS, within the RAMPART-A site architecture. The new
capabilities will enable increased collection of communications available at each RAMPART-A site.

•	(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Upgrade collection capabilities at each site to increase intelligence
production.

•	(TS//SI//NF) Develop additional access to communications links at each RAMPART-A site. This additional
access will increase the amount of international network coverage available for intelligence exploitation.

•	(TS//SI//NF) Develop one new Foreign Partner relationship that will enable NSA/CSS to access
international communications of high interest for intelligence exploitation.

•	(TS//SI//NF) Deploy, operate, or refresh systems to implement key CNCI goals against increasingly
complex communication signals at five RAMPART-A sites and two WINDSTOP sites.

(U) Changes From FY 2012 to FY 2013:

(S//NF) WINDSTOP: -$17.8 million (-$17.8 Base). The aggregate decrease is the result of:

•	(U) Increases:

—	(S//SI//NF) $1.0 million to sustain the current level of operations and accesses with its Second-Party
partners.

—	(S//SI//NF) $0.9 million for increased sustainment cost of current operations and Second-Party
relationships.

TOP SECRET//SI/TK//NOFORN

—	(S//NF) $0.1 million in civilian pay and benefits.

• (U) Decreases:

—	(S//SI//NF) $19.1 million reduces NSA/CSS' ability to deliver shared access opportunities at the scale
originally envisioned.

—	(TS//SI//NF) $0.7 million for deficit reduction and reduces NSA/CSS' ability to expand tasking of

new high priority targets	at 2nd party

UK accesses, thus limiting NSA/CSS' flexibility to optimize the current set of tasked signals.

(S//NF) RAMPART - A Modernization: -$0.5 million (-$0.5 Base). The aggregate decrease is the result of:

•	(U) Increases:

—	(S//NF) $0.1 million in civilian pay and benefits.

•	(U) Decreases:

—	(S/SI//NF) $0.6 million in equipment purchased for the sustainment of critical RAMPART-A foreign
partner sites.

(S//NF) RAMPART - A Operations: -$0.3 million (-$4.3 Base, +$4 OCO). The aggregate decrease is the
result of:

•	(U) Increases:

—	(TS//SI//NF) $4.0 million Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) provides an upgrade to the

processing suite at one RAMPART-A's foreign partner site, which will exploit the latest technologies
present in	networks. This upgrade consists of the design, procurement,

integration, testing and deployment of advanced processing capabilities hosted on the latest server
technology.

—	(S//SI//NF) $1.3 million reflects the refreshment of collection equipment at one foreign partner site.

—	(S//NF) $0.3 million in civilian pay and benefits.

•	(U) Decreases:

—	(S/SI//NF) $5.9 million reflects the planned completion of additional site preparations for the
deployment of TURMOIL systems.
