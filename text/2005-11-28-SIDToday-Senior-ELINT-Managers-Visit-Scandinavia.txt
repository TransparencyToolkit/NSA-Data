(S//SI) John Canavan (Chief, NSA Colorado and DSOC), Morrie Levine (Director, Community
ELINT Management Office) and 
 (S333 Division Manager) recently traveled with
FAD representatives to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark to discuss ELINT and FIS-related
activities and mission requirements. Each visit with the corresponding SIGINT organization
resulted in specific briefings, discussions, actions and/or agreements. There were several central
themes associated across Partners:
Strong support from all US Partner entities for increased ELINT data exchanges and
analytical cooperation.
Each organization gained a better appreciation and understanding of their respective
ELINT capabilities, plans, and challenges.
A general recognition that each Partner has an exceptional cadre of ELINT analysts, and
they were enthusiastic about their mission and further teaming with NSA.
The Partners would like to work more closely with NSA and, as a result, would like ELINT
analytical tools, processing, training, reporting vehicles, etc., which are similar to those
of the U.S., so that in the end they are compatible with our architecture and strategic
plan.
NSA needs to "tap" into this reservoir of talented ELINT and FIS analysts and have them
assist us on high priority mission requirements (e.g., US as well as Partner). This will
require an investment on the part of NSA in terms of software tools, training, and/or
automation as we shift the emphasis from mainly collection towards further analytical
exchanges and reporting; thus moving the Partners up the SIGINT Reference Model.
As an indication of closeness and high level of support, two of the Partners were invited
to visit NSA Colorado in the future for follow-on discussions. In addition, there was some
discussion regarding participation in future ELINT technical conferences including the
World-Wide ELINT Conference scheduled for 24-25 October 2005.
All three Partners were interested in or were in the process of acquiring an ESP DASS
ELINT analytical suite (e.g., hardware and software package for filtering). There was a
good exchange on the current product capabilities, flexibility of design (e.g., COTS;
unclassified LINUX software), cost and delivery scheduling.

(S//SI) In summary, the trip was extremely successful and educational, giving us a solid
explanation of NIS, FRA and DISS ELINT capabilities, plans and relationship with NSA. The trip
forged a mutual respect and agreement that NSA (e.g., FAD and John's organization), CEMO and
the Partners need to work more closely together on these important relationships, which will
result in a more effective SIGINT product.
