Course Overview:
(U//FOUO) During the Cold War, the U.S. CI community had the luxury of playing defense.
Sometimes it failed, as a number of spies evaded detection for many years. These spies inflicted
serious damage on U.S. National Security. Today, the U.S. is at war and playing defense is no
longer an acceptable tactic.
(S//SI) To address the war on terror and the nexus between CI and CT, the National CI strategy
has adopted a more offensive posture. CI analysts have long-studied information on enemy
security services to deny and disrupt their collection efforts and also to penetrate their agencies.
Terrorist tactics rely on surprise, clandestine operations, and compartmentation. The tactics they
use provide the nexus between CI and CT. LTG Odom (USA, Ret) noted that "CI is intelligence
about the enemy's intelligence...because terrorists have much in common with spies, operating
clandestinely, CI must also include counterterrorism intelligence, both domestically and abroad."
This seminar, will examine the overlap in tactics and tradecraft between CI and CT.
(U//FOUO) Please consult the SINIO Website ("go sinio") for information on future events in this
series.
