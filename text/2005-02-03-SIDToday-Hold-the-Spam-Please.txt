Separating the wheat from the chaff when collecting e-mail traffic (S//SI)
(S//SI) Spam, or junk e-mail, makes up over 60% of the world's e-mail traffic. This is an
annoyance (at the very least) for the recipient. And when NSA intercepts target e-mails heavily
laden with this same spam, it becomes the Agency's problem as well. Spam affects NSA by
impeding our collection, processing and storage of DNI* traffic. Unfortunately, filtering out spam
has proven to be an extremely difficult and cumbersome task. It demands the use of hundreds of
constantly changing filter terms and runs the risk of false hits (i.e. eliminating valid, intelligencebearing e-mails instead of the unwanted spam).
(S//SI) Analysts in Proliferation and Arms Control SIGDEV (S2G23) and CES Data and Metadata
Services (S31541) have tackled the problem from a different angle. They have developed a way
to filter spam in-house through a metadata-tagging process that uses existing dictionary and
SCISSORS processing. This content- and volume-oriented approach is not a panacea, but it is
the only process actually doing something about spam. Presently, they are tagging an average
of 150,000 spam sessions a day in about two-thirds of data flows containing common e-mail.
Some analysts are reporting as much as a 40-percent reduction of spam in their daily searches,
but results vary by target.
(S//SI) Furthermore, these metadata tags should provide a more accurate means of measuring
and studying the overall effect of spam, and ultimately should help us adjust our front-end
collection. If you would like to know more about this anti-spam effort, contact
