He has<br>been assigned to that station since 1998 and is currently serving as<br>the Team Lead for Signals Research and Target Development. <br> made significant improvements to the collection efforts of<br>both COMINT and ELINT signals at FSD. The collecting strategies<br>he implemented for the station's Advanced Environmental Search<br>(AES) concept yielded 50% greater opportunities for COMINT<br>development successes. <br>also worked diligently with<br>the Weapons and Space personnel to develop a strategy for<br>collecting TECHELINT "Top Ten" signals, many directly addressing<br>the rapid proliferation of Very Wide Band threat radars, a high<br>priority for the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).<br>(S//SI)<br> efforts immediately following the terrorist<br>events of 11 September 2001 were also critical to the War on<br>Terrorism. He provided collection management advice to the Crisis<br>Support Cell, allowing the cell to become the focal point for nonreal time support to both FSD internal and external customers.<br> also made noteworthy contributions in the area of threat<br>warning support for an important counternarcotics operation,<br>Golden Harvest. His improvements allowed the DCI Crime and<br>Narcotics Center to successfully execute their mission, although<br>supported by FSD with reduced resources.<br>(S//SI) The runner-up,<br>, is assigned to Special<br>Source Operations at NSAW. <br> served as the collection<br>manager for a one-of-a-kind counternarcotics-related remote<br>collection system. He developed a comprehensive, cyclical process<br>to refine tasking, to perform quality assurance and to optimize the<br>collection strategy. <br> used numerous collection and<br>collection management tools to include GRANDMASTER, the use of<br>metadata and protocol analysis and new processes to exploit<br>service channel data. <br>contributions had very direct,<br>measurable impacts on the counternarcotics effort. His diligence<br>and tenacity to obtain high quality intercepts ultimately led to the<br>arrest of over 130 international drug producers as well as the<br>seizure of billions of dollars worth of drugs and millions of dollars of<br>cash and assets. The actionable SIGINT, stemming from intercept<br>detailing death threats to law enforcement personnel, saved lives<br>both directly and indirectly.<br>(C) Both the winner and the runner-up have also made<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Collection<br>Association Awards<br>1.
