They were<br>magnificently air conditioned, and ours was kept pitch black inside<br>to accommodate the various shifts that team members worked. I<br>never unpacked anything - we all just rummaged through our bags<br>in the dark with small red-lens flashlights. There was not much to<br>worry about finding, since I wore the same thing every day. One of<br>the many benefits of working for a Special Operations command<br>was that they allowed for relaxed grooming standards and had<br>alternative uniform regulations.<br>(U) While many people on BIAP had to wear full DCUs (desert<br>camouflage uniforms) despite the 125-degree heat, we wore PT<br>gear - black shorts and a brown tee shirt. I only donned my DCU<br>pants when I had to get "dressed up" for a VIP visit. This was a<br>much-appreciated blessing, since the heat was almost unbearable.<br>When I arrived, I suffered heat cramps for a few days which made<br>me walk around on my toes like a dinosaur. At least I was<br>providing some entertainment for the troops, I kept telling myself.<br>(U) The food was bland but not bad. We had a chow hall which<br>served four hot meals a day. Many were basically mass-reheated<br>MREs, but the hamburgers were nothing to complain about. Living<br>on Zulu time (Greenwich Mean Time) and not local time was an<br>interesting experience. I went to sleep as the sun was coming up<br>and constantly felt jet-lagged. The rest of BIAP, it seemed, was<br>running on local time, so it added a hurdle when coordinating<br>meetings.<br>(U/FOUO) The work with TF-20 was the best I've had the<br>opportunity to be a part of so far in my career at NSA. I was lucky<br>to be working with such an able and flexible command. Like most<br>NISTs, we worked 7 days a week, at least 13 or 14 hours a day.<br>Whenever an operation was in progress, which was almost every<br>day, we worked until it was done.<br>(S//SI) A majority of our work consisted of identifying and tracking<br>targets using PCS (Personal Communication Service) handsets. We<br>worked closely with the DIA interrogators, CIA case officers, allsource analysts, and many others to produce timely, actionable<br>intelligence. Sometimes we made PowerPoint presentations of our<br>findings, and other times we just made our case with verbal<br>briefings or diagrams sketched out on the white board. We did a lot<br>of educating non-SIGINTers on our capabilities and limitations, and<br>I learned an incredible amount about the other players in the<br>intelligence community and military structure.<br>(S//SI) Too often, I noticed, what we think is urgent and earthshattering may not be what our customer really needs.

On several occasions, we were able to hand<br>additional threat-related information to team leaders heading out<br>the door on an operation, just in time. Five minutes later, that<br>same intelligence would have been just wasted time and paper. I<br>had an amazing experience working in Baghdad and have gained a<br>perspective on the value of SIGINT that I hope never to lose.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
