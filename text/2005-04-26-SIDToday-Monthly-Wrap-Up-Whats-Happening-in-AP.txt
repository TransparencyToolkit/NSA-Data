A summary of recent events in A&P... (U)
Proliferation and Arms Control (PAC) Product Line Is Renamed the Combating
Proliferation (CP) Product Line (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) As of 17 April, S2G, the Proliferation and Arms Control (PAC) Product Line, has been
renamed the Combating Proliferation (CP) Product Line. The name change reflects a more
activist approach to dealing with proliferation players and aligns the PL more closely in name
with the national counterproliferation mission and partners. The PL change also aligns the
organization more closely in name with the Combating Proliferation Issue Management Team
(IMT), a key partner for the PL in making headway on the CP mission.
