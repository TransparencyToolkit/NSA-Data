(S//SI) Shrinking the SIGINT Collection Suite to the Size of a
Suitcase

An SCS office creates collection equipment for "traveling light." (S//SI)
(S//SI) Not all SIGINT collection can be carried out from fixed sites, or even from secure areas.
We must position collection equipment where it can best pick up the RF signals we want there's no getting around the laws of physics! Sometimes this means setting up shop in an
insecure or otherwise difficult location.
(TS//SI//REL) Take, for example, the below collection and relay facility on Camp Liberty in
Baghdad. It consists of an antenna shed atop two shipping containers, with access via the ladder
shown. 
 A
SIGINT'er working at this site will wish to get in and out as quickly as possible, and will not be
able to carry large pieces of equipment up the ladder in order to conduct survey operations.
 
 
(TS//SI) Collection site in Baghdad (TS//SI) SIGINT Optimization and Analysis Platform
(TS//SI//REL) For such cases, the Special Collection Service is always looking for ways to pack
the maximum amount of collection capability into the minimum amount of space. SCS's Access
and Analysis Division (AAD) recently developed a new, user-friendly collection suite called the
SIGINT Optimization and Analysis Platform, or "SOAP." It packs a variety of important collection
capabilities into a single Pelican container, using off-the-shelf hardware and custom SIGINTrelated software.
(TS//SI//REL) In its current form, SOAP comprises all of the following capabilities, which add up
to a versatile package:
Dual processor server class "lunchbox" computer
SCIATICA computer-assisted RF search tool
Repackaged compact microwave receiver
SHARKTAIL PCI receiver
MARMOT demodulator
HALFLEX radio processor
DIA DEM (diagnosis and demodulation) software
BLACKMAGIC modem analyzer
TAROTCARD and HOBGOBLIN payload analysis tools
JUGGERNAUT GSM processor
Other applications as required for the tasked mission
(S//SI) While virtually any antenna package can be used with the SOAP system, AAD developed
a lightweight and versatile system that ties directly into the SCIATICA search engine.
(TS//SI//REL) In addition to being useful for collection surveys and quick response situations,
the platform can be used in a remoted mode, thereby not putting an operator's safety at risk.
(S//SI) AAD continues to look at ways to construct even smaller and lighter collection suites for
the future. If you have questions about SOAP, please contact Christopher Green at
