See the NSA-all email for further details.<br>(U//FOUO) On 1 March 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assumed operational<br>control of nearly 180,000 employees from 22 different agencies. Six months later, the<br>Department is taking shape as it merges those agencies into a cohesive organization that will<br>allow it to best fulfill its "Homeland Security" mission. While the transformation is far from<br>complete (after all, this is the largest reorganization in the federal government in over 50<br>years!), NSA is there as it has been since Day 1 reaching out to support the new Department.<br>(C) Even before DHS began to articulate its INs (Information Needs), SID began to proactively<br>"push" Homeland Security-related SIGINT products to them. SID had existing well-established<br>relationships with organizations that have now been merged into the new Department, such as<br>the Secret Service and Coast Guard . SID continues to send reports directly to them; however,<br>we also send the reports to the DHS-wide designator (HOMESEC) to ensure other DHS<br>customers, including senior leadership, are also informed.<br>(S//SI) DHS customers' intelligence interests and their INs range from typical terrorist-related<br>topics, to views of foreign officials on U.S. policy decisions, economic conditions that may affect<br>foreign views on Homeland Security related initiatives, and even foreign responses to health<br>issues (such as recent reporting on the SARS epidemic). SID continues to work with DHS to<br>identify and formalize their SIGINT INs.<br>(S) SID Product Line offices have been very proactive in providing as much information as<br>possible in SECRET level tear-lines or Write-to-Release sections of reports. Furthermore, SID<br>Customer Response is looking for new and innovative ways to get both TS//SI and sanitized<br>SIGINT into the hands of customers as effectively as possible. This is especially important for<br>DHS, since they do not yet have a unified, internal classified computer network. The TS//SI<br>information is being disseminated across DHS, but there is no efficient means to share it. There<br>are a number of delivery/dissemination programs being considered to possibly use with DHS as<br>a testbed.<br>(U) This is a quick look at the kind of support SID has been providing to DHS. If you are<br>wondering what else we are doing, or you believe your office has a service or product that may<br>be useful in supporting this customer, contact the SID Account Manager for Homeland Security,<br> or the Senior Executive Account Manager, Pres Winter.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on the Department of Homeland Security and NSA's support to<br>it, to include the National Strategy for Homeland Security (July 2002), Executive Orders,<br>Directives and other documents impacting Homeland Security, please go to NSA's Homeland<br>Security Support Office homepage (or type "go homelandsecurity").<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
