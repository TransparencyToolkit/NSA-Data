During that same timeframe,<br>I had considered separating from the Air Force to become a school teacher/golf coach, but<br>decided otherwise. So when I heard about tutoring for our local schools, I thought, "Here is my<br>opportunity to get the best of both worlds!"<br>(U) So I contacted the Partners in Education (PIE) program manager, scheduled/viewed the<br>mandated video and signed the volunteer agreement form. I was ready to tutor on the subjects<br>that I felt stronger in. Now granted, being a college student myself, you would think that I could<br>help anyone regardless of the subject matter... Wrong! Following are three lessons that I've<br>learned through my years of volunteering with the PIE program.<br>Lesson #1 - The tutor must understand the material well enough to explain it in as many<br>different ways as necessary. The last thing you want to do to the students is confuse them more<br>than they already are. The primary reason they are receiving instruction from you is to clear any<br>confusion caused by their teacher.<br>Lesson #2 - A commitment throughout the school year is fundamental to the success of the<br>PIE program. Once you start tutoring students, they tend to get attached and expect you to<br>continue to help them throughout the school year. So unless you are willing to commit long<br>term, it may not be beneficial for you or the student.<br>Lesson #3 - Be prepared to take pride in your accomplishment. The feeling you get when your<br>students understand the material and are able to score higher on their tests or even avoid<br>summer school is above all others. Dedicate yourself to helping any of the students requiring<br>assistance and enrich the minds and spirits of these young people - it will continue to bear fruit<br>for years to come.<br>In summary, contact a PIE Coordinator and make a difference in a child's life.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
