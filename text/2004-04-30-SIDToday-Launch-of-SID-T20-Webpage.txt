(U//FOUO) Today, the SID Transformation 2.0 webpage is being launched! The purpose of this
webpage is to give the SID population a chance to weigh-in on the T2.0 initiative. To get to the
page, type "go sid-t2" in your browser.
(U//FOUO) In his five papers that outline his vision:
Transformation 2.0 - Cryptology as a Team Sport
Teaming between SID and IAD
Teaming Across the Entire Enterprise - no more Them and Us!
Teaming with our Intelligence and Information Assurance Partners.
Teaming with our Clients. It's not about us; it's about The U.S.
... Gen. Hayden has given us the "what".
(U//FOUO) As members of SID, we are now charged with developing the "how" that will make
the vision a reality. You can find these documents as well as other pertinent information
including the new Concept of Operations under Resource Documents on the SID T2 webpage.
(U//FOUO) Unique features of the SID T2 page are the Discussion Board and the Opinion
Papers portions. The Discussion Board enables non-realtime "chat" giving SIGINT-ers around
the world the opportunity to have a conversation about the T2.0 concept. The Opinion Papers
section is a place to post white papers, think pieces, or the like that contain a more in-depth
expression of your thoughts and ideas on the subject of information sharing.
(U) Don't miss this chance to let your ideas and thoughts be known.

"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet
