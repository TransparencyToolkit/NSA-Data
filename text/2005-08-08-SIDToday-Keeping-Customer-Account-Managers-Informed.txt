(U//FOUO) Keeping Customer Account Managers Informed
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 08/08/2005

(U//FOUO) As you know, SID has a very robust Customer Engagement Strategy that involves
many people and organizations across all directorates to ensure that SID successfully supports
its customers. Success depends on teaming so that we speak with one voice to customers. The
linchpin of this team is the Customer Account Managers (AM) in S11.
(U//FOUO) Working very closely with the Senior Executive Account Managers (SEAM), they are
the headquarters advocates for the entire SID relationship with each customer. As such, the AMs
are the primary focal point for the customer to engage the SIGINT enterprise. This does not
mean that everything goes through them, but that they need to be aware of issues related to
the customers so they can engage when appropriate as well as document issues for the SIGINT
enterprise.
(U//FOUO) As each of you meets and works issues with customers, plans new initiatives,
meetings, visits, etc., please ensure that the AMs are informed of your engagement
activities and, where practicable, include them in your customer meetings and discussions and
courtesy copy them on email exchanges. This will ensure that we have the most complete profile
of each customer and the proper engagement strategy to keep the relationship healthy. The
following URL contains a complete listing of both AMs and SEAMs:
(U//FOUO) Thanks for your continuing efforts to ensure that NSA remains at the top of the
Intelligence Community in customer engagement.
