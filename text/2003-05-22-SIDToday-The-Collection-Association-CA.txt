The<br>Collection Association membership has played a role in the many<br>successes of NSA at one point or another in their career. They tend<br>to care strongly about the collection field and work every day to<br>continue to learn, to improve, to research, to manage, to look at or<br>for new intelligence environments. They also work to pass on to<br>the next generation the knowledge that at times only comes with<br>years of experience--not from books-- to assist the future<br>collectors in upholding the high standards of the collection field.<br>(S//SI) Through the years, the role of the collector has evolved<br>from that of searching through the frequency spectrum with a<br>receiver with "line of sight" ground antennas to that of using<br>satellite receivers allowing collectors a larger area of coverage.<br>Many people still think of collectors as being the folks that "sit<br>rack", but the changing intelligence environment has provided<br>collectors a wide choice of areas to perform their skills. We still<br>have High Frequency (HF) environment collectors that "sit racks"<br>and "roll up on their targets" each day and identify their targets by<br>their operating characteristics or map a network of transmitters<br>within hours or days. But we now have engineers who go TDY to<br>set up equipment in the field and do surveys. Their official title<br>may be engineer, but when they collect data, for that moment,<br>they are a collector. Even the folks searching the Internet for<br>information, whether it is the written word, hidden message, etc.-they are collectors when they search and pull information from the<br>web.<br>(U//FOUO) During its life, the CA has recognized several individuals<br>with yearly awards. These awards were established not only to<br>recognize outstanding collectors and collection managers yearly,<br>but to honor those individuals whose names identify the awards<br>and who played an integral role in the collection community, as<br>well as the Collection Association. The CA Awards that are<br>presented each year to deserving individuals are the Ardisana<br>Collector of the Year Award, the Thomas Mooney Collection<br>Manager of the Year, the William Hunt, Sr. Technical Literature<br>Award. In 1997, the team award named for Norbert H.<br>Syzmanowski, commonly known as "Ski Team Award", was created<br>and was presented for the first time in 1998.
