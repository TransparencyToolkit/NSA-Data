(U) Letters to the Editor : A Look Back at 9/11

(U) The recent article "The Day After 9/11" prompted some recollections of that day:
Comment: (U//FOUO) Thank you for sharing this with the workforce. I was deployed to HQ
SFOR at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo, Bosnia when the attacks took place on 11 Sep 01. I was
working in the CJ-2 [Directorate of Intelligence] at the time. For several days, everyone had a
look of total shock. Many of our NATO partners, total strangers to me, came up to me and
expressed their concern and horror over this event. We were one.
-- 
Comment: (U) First, thank you for sharing that.
(U) Second, you should know that the following also happened:
1. The Swedish guard in their morning gathering stood too, without their hats. The last time that
they had done that was when Queen Christiana died in the 17th Century;
2. The bells in all of the churches in Switzerland tolled for over 5 minutes... That had NEVER
happened since Switzerland was a nation;
3. A German warship, at that time in manuevers with the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, brook
from aside the Roosevelt, and when she returned, all of the crew of the German ship had come
out in their dress uniforms, they dropped the German flag, raised the American flag, and had a
sign that said, "We Are With You."
(U) Just thought that you would like to know.

as an article. -- The editor
