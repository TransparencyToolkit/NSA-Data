DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) <br><br> is the DA Technical Director<br><br>FROM:<br>Data Acquisition Technical Director<br>Run Date: 11/03/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) I am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to serve as the Data<br>Acquisition Technical Director and as Chief of the Technical Advocate Office. I look forward to<br>meeting the challenges of the job. One of the benefits of this position is that within DA there are<br>an extraordinarily large percentage of highly technical people. Even <br> the Deputy<br>Director for Data Acquisition was initially elevated as a DISL. One of my challenges will be to<br>effectively engage the members of the DA technical community and to be an advocate on their<br>behalf.<br>(S//SI) As the DA Technical Director I am responsible for working as a member of both the DA<br>and SID leadership teams and to assure that technical issues are appropriately represented and<br>incorporated into strategic planning and tactical resource decisions. In order to accomplish, this I<br>spend a significant amount of time each week with the members of the SID Technical Leadership<br>Team. The team is comprised of the Technical Directors from CRD , A&amp;P; , DA , SIGDEV , SID<br>Systems Engineering and the SID Chief Technology Officer . The Chief, SID/RAD Bridge and the<br>ITIS TD often attend as well. This group usually meets three times each week for one or two<br>hour sessions to discuss topics ranging from prioritizing the research agenda that SID will send<br>to RAD to working with the system engineers who are designing the common data model to<br>assure that it will fit all of SID's needs. I strongly encourage anyone who feels they have SIDlevel technical issues to contact us.<br>(S//SI) One focus of this group is to continue the development and rollout of the Layered Zone<br>Model (LZM). The LZM is a functional description of how the SIGINT system will operate in the<br>future. It provides strategic direction for developing critical capabilities needed for<br>transformation, and thus will drive programmatics and technological and analytical evolution.<br>The LZM is not intended to replace the SIGINT architecture, but to provide guidance on critical<br>directions that the SIGINT system must take. It advocates for three distinct business lines:<br>Sustaining Production, Tip-offs and Alerts, and SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) - major SIGINT<br>focus areas in the future. It also identifies critical functionality in the following areas: making<br>the SIGINT system more transparent to customers, to the extent that law and policy will allow,<br>and creating an Internet-like analytic environment which will take full advantage of the rich<br>collection access available now and in the future. (See the LZM diagram ).<br>(U//FOUO) The Technical Advocate Office (S3T) is comprised of the following elements:<br>(U//FOUO) Cryptologic Mathematician Program (CMP) and the Cryptanalysis Intern Program :<br>The CMP program and the CA intern program recruit, hire, diversify and train the next<br>generation of cryptomathematicians and cryptanalysts.<br>(U//FOUO) Data Acquisition Fellows Program : The Fellows program is typically a three year<br>program intended to offer technical leadership opportunities to highly motivated mid-career<br>technologists. The tours are usually a year or so in duration.<br>(S//SI) Target Technology Trends and Analysis Center (T3C): The T3C, part of the SIGDEV<br>community, is responsible for monitoring developments in telecommunications technology,<br>anticipating how targets of interest will use this technology, and predicting the technology's<br>impact on the Signals Intelligence Directorate's ability to monitor targets. The T3C provides key<br>inputs to anticipatory investment strategies for research, development and analysis to prepare<br>for the future.<br>(U//FOUO) Research POD Program : The pod program, established in 1997, accepts proposals<br>from anyone who believes that the proposed area of study is a topic to which the Agency should<br><br> </p>devote resources. All pod proposals are presented to a research committee of senior technical<br>experts from throughout the Agency. Pod participants are also drawn from throughout the<br>Agency, Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and our second party partners. There have been a<br>total of 35 pods and 4 are currently active.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
