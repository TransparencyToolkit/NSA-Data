Many of the skills resident among the<br>workforce do not exactly grow on trees, and it is of critical importance that SID find a way to<br>retain those skills. Where there's a will, there may be a way: last week, MG Quirk signed a new<br>SID policy on secure telecommuting.<br>(U//FOUO) A few key points:<br>The policy applies to SID civilian full-time and part-time employees.<br>The telecommuting must be conducted from a suitable remote secure government facility<br>where local management is amenable to hosting the telecommuter. (It is a violation of<br>DoD policy to allow telecommuting from a residence.)<br>Approval for telecommuting is given on a case-by-case basis, and at the discretion of SID<br>management - it is not an employee entitlement.<br>Supervisors are responsible for determining which positions are appropriate for secure<br>telecommuting and what skill sets are required for these positions.<br>(U//FOUO) This innovative policy gives SID new flexibility to keep employees with critical skills our must important asset - working to produce SIGINT.
