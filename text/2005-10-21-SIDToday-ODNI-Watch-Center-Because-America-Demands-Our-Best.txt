(U) ODNI Watch Center - Because America Demands Our Best
FROM:
Deputy Director, ODNI Watch Operations Center
Run Date: 10/21/2005

(U//FOUO) We recently published an interview with the ODNI Watch Director, Dennis Chapman .
Now here's some insight into "Life on the ODNI Watch"...
(U//FOUO) If you were working on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
Watch today, what kinds of things might you do? Well, you might...
talk to the Director of one of the Intelligence Community (IC) agencies;
facilitate a call between the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence
(DNI);
wake up General Hayden to tell him about a terrorist attack;
facilitate the IC response to a natural disaster;
read an advance copy of a Presidential speech; or
gather information for the ODNI Watch "State of the Community" (SOC) document.
... to cite a few possibilities.
(U//FOUO) In reality, almost anything can happen. Our charter states, "The ODNI Watch
Operations Center is the DNI's principal duty office, crisis management center, and locus for
tracking information on breaking world events." On the watch, we adhere to the ABCs.
(U//FOUO) A is for Alert. We stay aware of breaking world events by regular interaction with
the rest of the intelligence community (IC), primarily through their watch offices. Collaboration
in this manner allows us to stay atop the vast wave of information that follows these events. In
many instances, we are tipped to impending reporting streams from the IC and can proactively
engage the appropriate level of ODNI leadership.
(U//FOUO) B is for Brief. We regularly brief the DNI, his principal deputy, and other DNI
Deputy Directors on current events.
(U//FOUO) C is for Communication. The ODNI Watch facilitates both secure and non-secure
telephone communications between the ODNI Principals and other U.S. Government officials and
foreign leaders.
(U//FOUO) The DNI's mandate to everyone working in the ODNI and the IC is to build a
community among the 15 intelligence community agencies -- and on the watch we are truly a
community. We have watch personnel from NGA, NSA, State, DIA, FBI, and will soon be
welcoming our first members from CIA. We don't act as representatives of our home agencies,
but rather use our knowledge and contacts to facilitate the flow of information among agencies.
(U//FOUO) Our access to information is really unprecedented. In addition to having access to
our home agency accounts, each watch member can access a number of other streams of
information through CIA CWE2, FBI SCION, Open Internet, SIPRNET, JWICS, and an almost
limitless variety of television news channels including Al Jazeera.
(U//FOUO) The "State of the Community" has been praised by the DNI as one of the first
examples of an ODNI success. This document is an Intelligence Community posture paper
concerning topics of interest to ODNI leadership. By gathering concise information on how the IC
is postured to respond to these topics, the ODNI Watch is able to provide ODNI leadership with
a quick reference to capabilities and gaps in our response. The watch has done SOCs on
Hurricane Katrina, the earthquake in Pakistan, unrest in Haiti, politics in Bolivia and Venezuela,
and the possible impact of an Avian Flu pandemic, among others.

 (U//FOUO) If you think you might be interesting in joining this diverse team, please contact Mr.
Dennis Chapman, ODNI Watch Director

, ODNI Watch
Deputy Director [
