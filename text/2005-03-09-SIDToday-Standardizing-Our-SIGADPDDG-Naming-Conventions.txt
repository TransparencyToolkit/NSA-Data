(U//FOUO) Standardizing Our SIGAD/PDDG Naming Conventions
FROM: 
SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)
Run Date: 03/09/2005

The GOLDPOINT 2 database of standardized access names will make it easier to track the flow of
data; application in budget affairs, as well. (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) I want to tell you about a recent initiative that highlights our commitment to
streamlining processes within Data Acquisition. It is GOLDPOINT 2, a new database which will be
used to update and maintain the NSA/CSS master list of SIGAD/PDDGs*.
(U//FOUO) GOLDPOINT 2 began as a way to create a standard for naming conventions that
relate to our accesses, and manage those naming conventions across the SIGINT system. The
primary goal is to better track what data is coming into the building, and from where. Further, it
will establish a baseline of information that brings us closer to accomplishing the Agency-wide
goal of integrating performance measurement and budget.
(TS//SI) To justify funding levels, it is critical to show how a given program has performed in the
past or how it is expected to perform in the future. The new database will make it easier to
connect all of our programs' performance with their corresponding budget lines. GOLDPOINT 2
will make it possible for all of SID to use the same program names. So, when Congress talks to
DA about endpoint, DA will be able to show the program in its entirety and not have to pick
endpoint-related projects out of several categories as we now do. The same holds true for the
cable and RF programs. All offices need to be using and reporting on identical data using
approved business rules.
(TS//SI) The following is the approved list of access type categories:
RF
CABLE
ENDPOINT
RF/ENDPOINT
CABLE/ENDPOINT
PROTECTED
(S//SI) The next step is to align all programs/projects into the following access detail :
BLARNEY
CLANSIG
CLASSIC
CES
OTRAS
CSG
ENDPOINT
FAIRVIEW
FIXED ACTIVITIES
RESERVE ACTIVITIES
FORNSAT
FORNSAT/ENDPOINT
HARBORVIEW
HF
HFDF
MIDPOINT RF
MOBILE

 MORGAN
NASP
NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVITIES
OAKSTAR
RAMPART-A
RAMPART-M
RAMPART-T
RESERVE ACTIVITIES
SCS
SCS/CLASSIC/ENDPOINT
SCS/ENDPOINT
STORMBREW
TACTICAL
THINGSGOLD
TRYST
VOICE
DATA
CLOSE ACCESS
(U//FOUO) Using these standard naming conventions will allow us to eliminate duplicative and
erroneous program names, while maintaining a common set of program definitions.
(U//FOUO) The development of GOLDPOINT 2 was carried out by the DA Performance
Management team, with significant help from the Customer Relationships Directorate and the
Corporate Data Warehouse. For additional information on how GOLDPOINT 2 will be
implemented and managed, please contact
