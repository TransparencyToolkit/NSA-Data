have contact with the leasing company.

BREAKDOWN (on-road failure)

(S//SI) **EXCEPTION: In keeping with OPSEC purposes (i.e., FBI
recommends following an indirect route between NS A and Covert sites), the most
direct route may be improper. This is at the discretion of the operator and based

on guidelines provided by the FBI or the I

Security Office.

OFFICIAL USE OF NSA ’COVER " VEHICLES

(S//SI) The operation of all NSA vehicles is restricted to "official uses" only.
Official uses are those which are necessary to accomplish the Agency's mission
when operating under a "cover" capacity. Employees are subject to strict
penalties when they operate vehicles for other than official uses.

(S//SI) Normally, the answer to what constitutes official use is a matter of
management discretion, to be exercised within applicable laws and regulations.
Supervisors should ensure that all vehicles under their control are being used
solely in direct support of the NSA mission. Before requesting or using NSA
vehicles, the following questions must be asked:

1.	Is the use of the vehicle for official business and in die best interest to
die Government?

2.	Have other means of completing the task been ruled out (i.e.,
telephone, fax, mail)?

3.	Is the official business being performed in a "cover" capacity?

(U//FOUO) Personnel using cover vehicles, widi business at covert facilities,
should avoid direct routes to and from NSA. Good security practices should be
employed when determining the route. While there are rules involving overt
government vehicles requiring the use of die most direct route between locations,
they do no apply to cover vehicles. However, this should not be construed as
permitting the use of the vehicle for personal business or other improper
activities.

(U//FOUO) Some activities which are not normally considered official use of
Government vehicles are: stopping by any employee's home; personal errands;
going to pick up food, coffee mess goods, or travel to luncheons; transporting
supplies to organizational picnics; and sightseeing. With the exception of parking
in conjunction with official business, Agency vehicles should not, as a general
rule, stop in NSA employee parking areas (i.e.; to transfer items, retrieve personal
goods or coffee mess items).

OPERATION OF VEHICLES

(U) Agency motor vehicles will be used in such a way as to maximize fuel
economy and to extend the life of the vehicle.

when parked. This includes shutting off the engine, setting the parking brake,
