(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce
another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe
these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are
interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(S//SI) 
 will be discussing the Automated System (APSTAR), being developed for the
exploitation of Open Source information. Below is a brief description of his planned presentation.
(S//SI) The T3C's Tools Division is researching and prototyping tools for automating data
harvesting, entity/relationship extraction, machine translation, and knowledge discovery. This
system will allow multiple means of query and provide novel methods of data presentation and
visualization. Among the advanced methods being implemented are Semantic Technologies and
the use of ontologies for data modeling. The APSTAR system will eventually be available
enterprise-wide on the NSA classified desktop. Come learn about what we're developing and see
if there is something to benefit you. Our guess: There is!
