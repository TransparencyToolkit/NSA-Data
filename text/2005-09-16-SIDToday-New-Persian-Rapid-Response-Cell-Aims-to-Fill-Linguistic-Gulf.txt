(U//FOUO) New 'Persian Rapid Response Cell' Aims to Fill Linguistic
Gulf
FROM:
PRRC
Run Date: 09/16/2005

(U//FOUO) Small team of experienced Persian linguists to assist in surge operations, mentor
junior linguists.
(U//FOUO) Last week, SID and the Senior Language Authority established a new unit: the
Persian Rapid Response Cell (PRRC). The PRRC, currently composed of three senior Persian
language analysts from three separate product lines, is designed to provide a flexible response
to crisis-related surges that demand experienced and qualified Persian language analysts.
Equally as important as their production responsibilities, PRRC members also mentor and
provide operational training to junior Persian language analysts, who are spread across multiple
product lines at NSAW.
(U//FOUO) The PRRC was formed in response to several ongoing factors. One is that as concern
over Iran's activities continues to grow, so do the demands and workload on NSA's Persian
language analysts, who are deployed in S2E, S2G, S2D, S2C, S2I, etc. SID's Persian language
resources are easily spread thin and often unable to respond rapidly and flexibly to surge
situations. Additionally, a significant number of Persian linguists are new hires or new in the
language and require focused mentoring, wherever they are deployed. The PRRC proposal
contains more information on the PRRC's role and functions, and the reasons it was formed.
(U//FOUO) The PRRC is composed of
 (S2E; Chief/PRRC),
(S2D) and
 (S2G).
For information on our background and qualifications, see our bios .
(U//FOUO) If you require mentoring assistance, simply send an email to
@nsa and one of
us will get back to you right away. If you have a surge of Persian language material, please refer
to the surge procedures and we will do everything possible to address your critical need.
