DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Building the ARC (Professional Skills Inventory)<br>FROM: The DANCEHALL Team<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/16/2003<br><br>(U) Despite the fact that the rain in Maryland has appeared to be endless at times recently, an<br>upcoming activity in SID-- the "build the ARC"-- is actually unrelated to our soggy weather<br>patterns!<br>(U//FOUO) Beginning today, 16 June, the S2 workforce will be asked to start populating a<br>database of skills, knowledge and abilities in support of the Intelligence Community's Analytic<br>Resources Catalog (ARC). Our Director, Lt Gen Hayden, supports NSA's participation in this<br>effort initiated by Mark Lowenthal, ADCI/AP (Assistant DCI for Analysis and Production). S2 will<br>be the first organization to provide data to the ARC, but eventually all analysts throughout the<br>NSA extended enterprise will be included in the database .<br>(U//FOUO) The datacalls will be conducted by the DANCEHALL Team using a tool called the<br>Cryptologic Volunteer Application (CVA). Simply entering data via CVA does not indicate,<br>however, that an employee is volunteering for a new placement or will be subjected to an<br>involuntary directed assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided. Individuals<br>who would like to be considered for a move should follow the procedures described in the<br>Cryptologic Vacancy Application process to volunteer for a specific position. Likewise, we have<br>the assurance of the ADCI/AP that the ARC will not be used to locate mission experts within<br>individual Intelligence Community (IC) agencies for involuntary deployment.<br>(U//FOUO) The DANCEHALL team will notify individual Product Lines when each is to begin<br>participating in the inventory. At that time, all members of the product line will be provided with<br>working aids and contact information for DANCEHALL team members, should additional<br>assistance be required. The amount of time required varies depending on the breadth of target<br>expertise, but it is estimated that an average of 30 minutes of mission time per person is<br>required to complete the professional skills inventory. The accuracy, integrity, and thoroughness<br>of your responses are essential to conveying an appropriate picture of mission health within NSA<br>and the analytic capabilities of the IC. The ARC's mission areas for analytic expertise are aligned<br>to the 30 new National Intelligence Priority Framework issues from NSPD-26. Because data<br>collected on the expertise and experience of our workforce are also being applied to internal<br>mission management processes, including the S2 mission posture and ongoing efforts to<br>quantify and redress the JCS Intelligence Analysis Joint Monthly Readiness Review (JMRR)<br>deficiency, the survey must be completed by 100% of the workforce.<br>(U//FOUO) The Office of China and Korea (S2B) piloted the collection of data for the ARC in<br>early 2003. Their participation resulted in many improvements to CVA. The pilot also benefitted<br>S2B: DANCEHALL Team partners in Operations Research Modeling and Simulation will use the<br>input data to provide S2B management with mathematical modeling for technical health<br>assessments, gap analysis and resource optimization proposals.<br>(U) The DANCEHALL team and ARC developers thank you in advance for your participation and<br>cooperation.
