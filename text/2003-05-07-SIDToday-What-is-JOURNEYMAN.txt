Bottom line, we're going to deliver new capabilities for authoring and<br>disseminating SIGINT information.<br>(U//FOUO) What does this mean for the analyst? --the ability to write once and disseminate<br>your information in the format the customer needs. For example, you, the analyst, may author<br>information that will be...<br>issued as an EGRAM-like report to customers on Intelink and via CRITICOMM,<br>issued as a SECRET-level report that will be sent over the SIPRnet with no attribution to<br>NSA, and<br>automatically parsed and included in a database the customer can access<br>...but you write it just once!<br>(U//FOUO) In addition, the SIGINT sourcing information will be retrievable without the need for<br>you to enter information into numerous fields on a source record sheet, while dissemination will<br>be driven by a customer profile much like a magazine subscription service. Further relief will be<br>afforded by desktop-validation capabilities, a robust workflow capability, and the automatic<br>identification of relevant Information Needs. Analysts will even be able to include multimedia<br>information in the report. This isn't going to happen overnight. We'll deliver capabilities<br>incrementally, using off-the-shelf software whenever possible.<br>(C) Our initial foray to deliver the Journeyman vision was the rollout of the SIGINT On Demand<br>Tool to all NSAW analysts in May 2002. This product continues to be refined, with the latest<br>version incorporating the current web-based application technologies (rollout scheduled for April<br>2003), and adding a commercial customer interface tool (June 2003) that will enhance both the<br>presentation of the information and metrics. Our next major effort will be the delivery of<br>TALISMAN (formerly the Consolidated Authoring Tool - CAT). A demonstration of this tool is<br>scheduled for April 2003, and there will be an Interim Operating Capability (IOC) in two NSAW<br>offices - that are currently being chosen - in September 2003. This tool will ultimately replace all<br>the legacy end-product reporting capabilities throughout the extended enterprise.<br>(U//FOUO) Please bear with us during the transformation. We're trying to connect different<br>systems/technology, some of it decades old; it isn't an easy process and sometimes we won't hit<br>a home run. We depend on you for input and suggestions to improve our current product suite,<br>or to identify the need for new capabilities. We encourage everyone to view our website ('go<br>JOURNEYMAN') for additional information on what projects are underway, provide feedback, and<br>view our vision of the future authoring and dissemination system by reading the JOURNEYMAN<br>CONOP or by contacting the JOURNEYMAN Project Manager,<br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
