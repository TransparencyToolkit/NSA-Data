(U) Topic: Global Collaboration Environment (GCE)

(U//FOUO) Director's Talking Points:

•	(S//REL TO USA, GBR) Thank GCHQ for giving full support to GCE, and for
partnering with NSA to engage in synchronized messaging to other organizations.

•	(S//REL TO USA, GBR) Encourage GCHQ to host the permanent facility for the joint
SSEUR collaboration center, in order to maximize the benefit for the Five Eyes
partnership.

•	(S//REL TO USA, GBR) Offer NSA's assistance in finding good solutions for
incorporating GCE access into GCHQ's analytic workflow. Encourage GCHQ to engage

with NSA's TD on this subject.

(U) Background:

BEL TO USA, GBR) On 02April2013, SID Foreign Partner Strategist (FPS)

held a discussion with	(Head of Bilateral and Multilateral Relations, GCHQ

International Relations) to discuss the future of GCE in a post-Afghanistan era. The two
discussed the benefits of NSA and GCHQ having a united front in its dealings with the other
foreign partners on this issue. They also discussed the possibility of the UK hosting a permanent
facility where analysts from partner nations could be co-located, along with ways to better
integrate GCE into each partner's analytic workflow.

(U) Conversation Summary:

• (S//REL TO USA, GBR) GCHQ is "all-in" on the GCE concept, both virtually and
supporting some type of permanent facility where analysts could be co-located. GCHQ
wants to be in sync with NSA in messaging the concept in Partner meetings. In^|

Sview, the SIGINT Seniors Europe (SSEUR) Principals are mostly "all-in" on
E, but that message needs to be driven down to working levels in SSEUR nations
where there is persistent pushback.

• (S//REL TO USA, GBR)	wants GCHQ's technical personnel to engage with

TD more vigorously so GCHQ can find good solutions for incorporating GCE access into
their analytic workflow. He indicated GCHQ has some catching up to do regarding
NSA'sapproach tohowGCE will be integrated into NSA's analyticworkflow-
advised	that GCHQ should reach out to

(Chief, T32 - Enterprise Connectivity & Specialized IT Services) to discuss integration
options.

(S//REL TO USA, GBR)	is going to explore whether the UK could host a

permanent facility for a joint SSEUR collaboration center. Messrs.	(SID Foreign

Partner Strategist) and	thought a UK-hosted facility would be optimal in terms of

having the most flexibility in tuning the operation to benefit the Five Eyes. There was

discussion concerning the French hosting a permanent site, especially in terms of trying
to incorporate a French-based collaboration infrastructure vs. GCE.

•	(S//REL TO USA, GBR) Some European nations may be leery about hosting a facility in
their nation partly based upon uncertainty on what missions the center will support, and
associated concerns for European human rights laws.

•	(S//REL TO USA, GBR) The discussions also included a Five-Eyes messaging approach,
with the intent of encouraging coalition transition from the dated and functionally limited
(but sovereign) SIGDASYS infrastructure to the advanced, US-hosted, COI-based GCE
infrastructure. NSA's messaging is currently focused on presenting GCE as an additive
capability providing a joint operational model based upon the Afghan SIGINT Coalition
(AFSC) - which SIGDASYS doesn't provide. NSA has also started a messaging
campaign with some trusted Third Party partners to encourage SSEUR mission groups to
explore the GCE option once the SSEUR COI becomes fully operational and open to all
members. NSA is working with Norway (who hosts SISECT) to do some initial testing of
the SSEUR COI and plan to open it to all SSEUR members in the coming weeks.

(S//REL TO USA, GBR) There will likely be GCE-related discussions during GREY
GHOST (SSEUR Conference in June 2013), along with a SIGINT Seniors Executive
Board (SSEB) task force update on a recommendation for a temporary or permanent
solution for future Support to Military Operations (SMO) or crisis support operations.
Also expected is an SSEUR COI update and case studies/lessons learned from recent or
ongoing crisis support missions (e.g., In-Amenas, Syria, Mali, Somali Piracy).
