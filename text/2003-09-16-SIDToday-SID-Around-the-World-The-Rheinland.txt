DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Around the World: The Rheinland<br>FROM:<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/16/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Having served on one field tour at NCEUR, Stuttgart,<br>Germany, in the mid-1990s, I was once again fortunate to get an<br>offer for another field assignment in Germany just two years later,<br>at NSA's European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden. The<br>position at ETC was as a Foreign Relations Staff Officer, responsible<br>for coordinating technical support to NSA's Third Party partners in<br>Europe and the Middle East. My wife served as NSA's liaison to the<br>Army's 66th Military Intelligence Group in Darmstadt. We lived<br>between Wiesbaden and Darmstadt, due south of Frankfurt, and<br>our school-age children went to the DoDDs school in Darmstadt.<br>(S//SI) For a career Intelligence and Language Analyst, the most<br>interesting and rewarding aspects of working at ETC were exposure<br>to the engineering work that NSA does and to the superb group of<br>people who carry it out. It was a pleasure, indeed, even an<br>inspiration, to deal with the technical personnel who put SIGINT<br>and related systems in place, to witness their expertise, and to<br>gain greater awareness of technical support, maintenance, and<br>logistics problems. The engineering and logistics friends I made in<br>Wiesbaden are ones I would likely not have met in my regular<br>career field back home, and I learned a lot from them. Supporting<br>NSA's foreign partnerships and sometimes dealing directly with<br>foreign partners was a particularly interesting experience as well.<br>(U) Outside of work, the most rewarding aspect of living in the<br>Rheinland area of Germany is the opportunity to travel across<br>Germany and much of Europe. France, the Benelux countries, and<br>Switzerland are all within a few hours' drive, for a weekend or, for<br>border destinations such as Strasbourg, even a day trip. For longer<br>drives, Paris and Berlin are within six hours drive, the Alps are 3-7<br>hours away, depending on which mountain is being sought, and<br>other destinations - in southern France, the Czech Republic,<br>Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, and Italy - are within<br>reasonable long-distance reach for an extended vacation. Living<br>near Frankfurt also puts one very close to rail and air connections<br>to anywhere in Europe, including low-cost air travel to many<br>European destinations. It was a thrill to be able to visit sites of<br>historical and cultural significance during our tour, and living in<br>Germany has marked our children with a considerable appreciation<br>for European history and culture.<br>(U) The middle Rhein area between Mainz/Wiesbaden and Koblenz<br>is quite scenic and offers many opportunities to sample aspects of<br>German life, especially gastronomic pleasures, closer to home. You<br>don't have to go far to find a really good white wine, for some very<br>good Rieslings may well be just down the street. Wiesbaden is<br>located within the Rheingau wine area; the Rheinhessen is just<br>across the Rhein, and the Rheinpfaltz (Rheinland Palatinate) and<br>Mosel-Saar-Ruwer regions, as well as the French province of<br>Alsace, are close by. Even lesser-known wine regions, like<br>Franconia, are within reach.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.  Coming Soon: SID<br>Around the World!<br>2.

I have not had a bad German<br>meal yet. Local specialties abound; in the Rhein/Main plain closer<br>to Darmstadt, the Germans grow the sweet, white asparagus<br>("Spargel") that is harvested in May and enjoyed throughout<br>Germany. The strawberry season follows immediately thereafter.<br>(U//FOUO) It might belabor the obvious that I enjoyed living in<br>Germany to no end. Working and living in the field is a great<br>experience, and working at ETC and living in Germany was no<br>exception. I'd do it again.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
