1.	(TS//SI//REL) Project BULLRUN deals with NSA’s abilities to defeat the encryption
used in specific network communication technologies. BULLRUN involves multiple
sources, all of which are extremely sensitive. They include CNE, interdiction, industry
relationships, collaboration with other IC entities, and advanced mathematical techniques.
Several ECIs apply to the specific sources, methods, and techniques involved. Because
of the multiple sources involved in BULLRUN activities, “capabilities against a
technology” does not necessarily equate to decryption.

2.	(U//FOUO) The BULLRUN data label (for use in databases) and marking (for use in
hard- or softcopy documents) are for internal NSA/CSS use only. It will appear in the
classification line and corresponding portion markings after all applicable ODNI-
approved markings are in place. The format is:

Classification//SCI Control System Markings//CAPCO-approved Dissemination Control
Markings/BULLRUN. Examples include:

•	TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY/BULLRUN

•	TOP SECRET//SI-ECIPIQ//ORCON/NOFORN/BULLRUN

3.	(U//FOUO) Appendix A lists specific BULLRUN capabilities. Details may be
protected by one or more ECI. Contact CES CAO for access to the appendix or further
guidance.

(U) 25 years*: Declassification in 25 years indicates that the information is classified for 25 years from the
date a document is created or 25 years from the date of this original classification decision, whichever is
later.

(U) ACRONYMS/DEFINITIONS:

(U) Capabilities - For the purposes of this classification guide, the NSA/CSS ability to exploit a specific
technology. This may encompass acquiring and processing plaintext data and/or acquiring, decrypting and
processing encrypted data.

(U) HTTPS - HTTP traffic secured inside an SSL/TLS session, indicated by the https:// URL, commonly
using TCP port 443

(U) IPSEC — IPSec, or IP Security, is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard for layer 3
real-time communication security. IPSec allows two hosts (or two gateways) to establish a secure
connection, sometimes called a tunnel. All traffic is protected at the network layer. (IETF is the Internet
Engineering Task Force, a loosely self-organized group of people who contribute to the engineering and
evolution of Internet technologies. It is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet
standard specifications.)

(U) PPTP - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is a method for implementing virtual private networks.
The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication features and relies on the protocol
being tunneled to implement security functionality.

(U) SSH - Secure Shell. A common protocol used for secure remote computer access

(U) SSL - Secure Sockets Layer. Commonly used to provide secure network communication. Widely
used on the internet to provide secure web browsing, webmail, instant messaging, electronic commerce, etc.

(U) TLS - Transport Layer Security. The follow-on to SSL, SSLv3 and TLSvl.O are nearly identical.

(U) VoIP - Voice over Internet Protocol. A general term for the using IP networks to make voice phone
calls. The application layer protocol can be standards-based (e.g., H.323, SIP), or proprietary (e.g., Skype).

(U) VPN - Virtual Private Network. A private network that makes use of the public telecommunications
infrastructure, maintaining privacy via the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures that typically
include encryption. Common protocols include IPSEC and PPTP.
