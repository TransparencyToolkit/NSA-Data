a1) POTENTLAL LANDMINES:

•	(TS SI NF) There is a chance that helping attribute the cyber attacks against the French
Presidential network may reveal a U.S. ally is responsible.

•	(TS SI NF) The French have not been forthcoming in sharing technical details of the
cyber attacks There is suspicion that the information is not being shared prior to the visit
because the French want to see how NSA responds when they present their findings.
Dining the January 2013 DIRNSA visit to Paris, both DGSE and ANSSI asked GEN
Alexander about the cyber attacks in an attempt to ascertain whether or not the U S was
responsible for the attacks (as reported in French magazines). At no time was FAD made
aware that DGSE and ANSSI intended to raise the issue with DIRNSA

(U) OTHER INFORMATION:

•	(TS 'SI NF) TAO confirmed that this was not a TAO operation TAO asked most of
NSA's close l51 2n<i Party Partners whether they were involved (CIA, GCHQ. and CSEC
were the mostly likely suspects): everyone has denied involvement TAO intentionally

did not ask either Mossad or ISNU whether they were involved as France is not an

advance of the visit), ANSSI and DGSE have not provided any details.

(U) RECENT PRESS INDICATIONS:

An initial press report from Paris Atlántico, “French Website Savs Turkish Hackers
Behind Elvsee Cvber Anacks." dated 12 July 2012, stated it was believed “the attacks
originated from France's allies ‘ and speculated Turkish hackers with possible links to
Turkish ‘ intelligence services or government bodies“ might be responsible. No follow--on
press reports have been seen that place blame on Turkey. A press report from Paris

L 'Express, “French Weekly Reports on Alleged US Cvber Espionage Attack on Elvsee
Palace,” dated 20 November 2012, shifted blame for the attacks toward the United States
On 27 November 2012. @rretsur images contacted the Pans L 'Express author who
