(U) Twice a month, SID senior leaders gather as a group to be briefed by members of the
workforce. These briefings, called SITRs (SID Intelligence and Technical Reviews -- pronounced
"sitters"), give analysts from across SID the opportunity to talk about what's happening in their
area of expertise. Sometimes the briefings serve to update management on the status of a longterm project, sometimes they relate a new "SIGINT success" the leaders should know about, and
on other occasions the briefings point out problem areas that need attention. The leadership
asks questions on the topic and provides guidance as appropriate.
(U//FOUO) Although the actual SITR presentations are attended by senior management only
(allowing sensitive issues to be discussed), the topics that are covered may be of interest to
others across SID, as well. The solution? SID today has added a new feature to its page: briefing
slides from recent SITRs are now available. Look for the link on the SID today homepage in the
"SID Notes/Reports" section (about halfway down the page).
(U//FOUO) Since the SID today page is limited to a maximum classification of TS//SI//5-EYES,
some briefings cannot be posted -- but we'll make available what we can. So, if you'd like to
know what's being briefed to management, periodically check this link!
