(S) SID Mailbag: Intelligence Analysts at SCS Sites

Here's a Q&A taken from the SID Mailbag (U)
Question :
(TS//SI) DIRgram-385 defined the Special Collection Service as a model for Expeditionary
Cryptology and I wholeheartedly agree. As an IA [Intelligence Analyst] in the Counterterrorism
product line, I have seen SCS sites provide invaluable support on a broad number of issues. I
have also seen a number people from the IA Development Program forward deployed to sites
and provide excellent TDY support to SCS. However, currently there are very few IA's actually
PCSed to the sites. It would seem to make sense to PCS IA's in order to let the LA's [Language
Analysts] and engineers to do the jobs they are best at and allow IA's to bring their target
development and reporting skills forward in the SIGINT system. How likely is such a change?
SCS's Answer :
(TS//SI) Thanks for the question and positive comments on both the SCS and their successful
deployment of individuals from the IA Development Program. Over the past two years, SCS has
recognized the value of IAs and their impact as SCS transitions from Local Support Reporting to
First Instance Reporting (FIRs--formal SIGINT reports). Currently, SCS is actively recruiting a
limited number of IAs for deployment overseas. We recognize their value to the Enterprise for
their outstanding reporting and network analysis skills. In fact, SCS has recently PCS'ed four IAs
(to Iraq, Pakistan, Egypt and Austria), and their contributions have been tremendous.
(TS//SI) A bit of history! SCS has recruited IAs in the past with additional skills in languages and
collection. WIth the advent of our FIRs initiative, we look forward to working with SID to identify
additional IA billets and resources to support this initiative. We will continue to staff our field
sites with linguists, global network collectors, and global network analysts, as well as additional
IAs in the future. SCS has always been able, per DIRNSA, to "swim further upstream" to support
customers' needs, and we look forward to including IAs PCS to field sites in our evolving mission
realignment plans.
(U//FOUO) Finally, any IA interested in an assignment with SCS should contact the SCS Field
Operations Office/Operations Assignment Staff at 
. We appreciate your question and
comments.
