This paper changes the relationship between<br>NSA's headquarters and field elements, and has a direct impact on how SID operates. Although<br>we recommend you read the entire paper (it's nine pages, but an easy read) for the full story,<br>we've excerpted below some of these key points that relate to SID:<br>(U) MISSION<br>(U//FOUO) The paper restates that "All SIGINT and related activities are under the direct<br>operational control of the Director of SID or his designated representative... In short,<br>headquarters elements will exercise operational control of their activity wherever it is found<br>across the enterprise. This control includes guidance, tasking, prioritization, and resource<br>allocation as well as the setting of policy, mission standards and performance metrics."<br>(U) COMMAND<br>(U//FOUO) "None of the above removes the responsibility of a field chief or a site commander<br>to act as a chief or commander. Headquarters elements exercise operational control of mission<br>in the extended enterprise through the chiefs and commanders . We will have centralized<br>direction, but we must also have decentralized execution."<br>(U) GOVERNANCE: WRIT LARGE<br>(U//FOUO) "...each headquarters mission area will be responsible - working through the chiefs<br>and commanders - for control of its respective activity on site. However, the mission activity<br>constituting the dominant activity at each site will have overall responsibility for site support and<br>performance. Accordingly, extended enterprise leaders will link directly to the following<br>headquarters mission elements:<br>Liaison offices, activities, and representatives performing predominantly foreign liaison FAD<br>CSGs [Cryptologic Services Groups]<br><br>SID/S1<br><br>RSOCs and MOC [Regional Security Operations Centers and the Meade Operations<br>Center]<br><br>SID/S2<br><br>Collection Sites; European and Pacific Technical Centers<br><br>SID/S3<br><br>(U//FOUO) "The NCRs [National Cryptologic Representatives] at Defense, State, Homeland<br>Security, and the Combatant Commands, and our representatives to our major Intelligence<br>Community partners do not fit entirely comfortably into the fighting forces paradigm -- they<br>function as our diplomatic corps as well. While responding to tasking from the mission areas,<br>these representatives will continue to report to me, with admin support from the Chief of Staff."<br>(U//FOUO) "NSA headquarters offices will make any organizational changes they need to make<br>to handle this new function. FAD is pretty far along in managing liaison offices but S2 will<br>probably need some work to adequately govern Medina, Gordon, Kunia, and Meade . I want S2<br>to think about and treat the RSOCs and MOC just the way they now deal with headquartersbased product lines. And I want the dialogue between them to be as immediate and as intense.<br>The same applies to S3 -- plugged in to field sites as tightly as they are to TAO . S1 may have<br>less to do if we can tie the SEAMS closely to our customer footprints (CSGs)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) MANPOWER<br>(U) "All of this demands some fundamental changes in the way we handle manpower issues in<br>a distributed enterprise. Simply put, SID and IAD will be responsible for operational billets<br>wherever they are located. ... All extended enterprise billets will be the responsibility of one or<br>another headquarters element."<br>(U//FOUO) Note: This article first appeared on January 28, 2004.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 <br><br> </p>
