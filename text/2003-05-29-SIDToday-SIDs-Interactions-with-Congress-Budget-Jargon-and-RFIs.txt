DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID's Interactions with Congress: Budget Jargon and RFIs<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 05/29/2003<br><br>(U) Today is part 2 in our 3-part series on SID and Congress:<br>(U) Budget Jargon<br>(U//FOUO) As with everything else, the budget process has its own<br>vocabulary. Here are a few terms you may hear:<br>Fence : When NSA funding is fenced, it means we cannot<br>spend those dollars until we satisfy certain requirements<br>levied on us by Congress. Fences are associated with<br>Congressional Directed Actions (CDAs).<br>With/Without Prejudice : When a cut is taken "with<br>prejudice", it means that NSA must take the cut from a<br>specified project/program. If a cut is taken "without<br>prejudice", we have the option of funding that<br>program/project at the level we requested and taking that<br>cut from elsewhere in the budget.<br>A not A : Appropriated not Authorized. This occurs when<br>the Appropriators provide funding for programs, but the<br>Authorizers do not give NSA the authority to spend it.<br>Hollow Authority : This occurs when the Authorizers give<br>NSA the authority to spend funds, however, the<br>Appropriators do not provide us the with the dollars.<br>Congressional Member/Staffer : The "member" is the<br>senator or congressman. The "staffer" is just that--one of<br>his staff. The staffers are led by a "staff director". Sensitive<br>classified information is sometimes shared only with the<br>staff director and members of Congress--not with the<br>staffers-- to limit distribution as much as possible.<br>(U) Where Are We in This Budget Process Now?<br>(U//FOUO) Right now, the SSCI has just completed its mark up,<br>while the other three committees are still working on theirs. SID LA<br>has just completed many briefings related to the CBJB, to provide<br>clarification or additional detail for the congressional staffers. Most<br>of the congressional Requests for Information (RFIs) or briefings<br>are centered on:<br>SID support to Operation Iraqi Freedom;<br>Data-sharing among Intelligence Community elements<br>(allowing analysts from other agencies access to raw<br>SIGINT data); and<br>TRAILBLAZER.<br>(U//FOUO) The House Appropriations Committee Survey and<br>Investigations (HAC S&amp;I;) is also investigating metrics for SIGINT<br>collection programs. This is essentially a cost/benefit analysis of<br>the various Expenditure Centers (ECs) for SIGINT collectors and<br>enablers.<br>(U) Which Congressional Staffers Do We Usually Deal With?<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID and Congress<br>1.
