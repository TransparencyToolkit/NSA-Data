You are! The war we are fighting -- not just<br>in Iraq, but the War on Terrorism -- is a global war. It is history in the making and you are part<br>of it, a critical part. Whether you work Latin America or Commerce and Finance, the UN mission<br>or the Balkans, you are contributing to this fight. Uncovering targets and prosecuting known<br>targets keeps the other side from gaining stability.<br>(U) As SIGINTer's we are being called upon to do more than ever before. As we have expanded<br>our capabilities, our leaders and commanders come to us for more and more intelligence opportunities for us to make a difference in history abound.<br>(U) I couldn't be prouder of your contributions and accomplishments in this war. Accolades from<br>all directions are piling up. But, we must not rest easy in the saddle. The burden of our<br>responsibility is great -- almost overwhelming, at times. It is hard to believe that tasks we<br>consider routine can have such a significant impact to our nation. Although the task seems<br>never-ending and we aren't always aware of the payoff, we need to remain vigilant and prod<br>ourselves to ratchet up another notch. That extra effort just might save a soldier's life. We<br>cannot forget how important the job is that we do.<br>(U) We must realize, too that we are not in this alone. Intelligence is a team effort and we must<br>respond to the nation's needs by being flexible and seeking opportunities to share and thereby<br>improve the Intelligence Community's products. Continue to be selfless in your efforts and think<br>only of the payoff for the customer.<br>(U) We are in this fight for the long haul. The War on Terrorism has just begun and we cannot<br>know when we will achieve victory. So keep in mind, as you do your daily tasks, that ours is a<br>unique opportunity to influence history. Keeping America safe is our vital mission.<br>(U) In the years ahead, I believe each of us will look back at this experience as a defining<br>moment in our lives.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
