(U) New USSID System On-Line
FROM: the USSID Re-engineering Team (S02L1)
Unknown
Run Date: 07/20/2005

(U//FOUO) Have you consulted a United States Signals Intelligence Directive (USSID) recently
and found the USSID number has changed? The USSID Re-Engineering team in SIGINT Policy
rolled out a new system for organizing on-line USSIDs on 11 July 2005. This roll-out was the
culmination of almost two years of work to transform the USSID system into a library of
information that represents the United States SIGINT System (USSS) of today and provides
room to grow for the USSS of tomorrow.
(U//FOUO) The system is based on a top-level structure that places USSIDs into seven major
groupings:
SIGINT Fundamental Policy,
Customer Relationships,
Analysis and Production,
Data Acquisition,
SIGINT Development,
SIGINT Generic, and
the SIGINT Enterprise.
Each major grouping is categorized into sub-groupings with individual USSIDs of similar topics
grouped together. New alphanumeric designators have been applied to the USSIDs to reflect
these groupings and sub-groupings. See
for additional information.
(U//FOUO) The renumbering and regrouping of the old USSID system is the first phase of the
USSID Re-engineering effort. In the next 12 months, USSIDs will be published on topics where
no policy existed before. Some current USSIDs will also be broken up into smaller pieces and
other current USSIDs consolidated with others to enable users to find information much more
easily. SIGINT Policy will continue to work with Subject Matter Experts in the SIGINT Enterprise
to improve the accuracy of the information.
(U//FOUO) Finally, those users who access the USSIDs on INTELINK will find a more complete
USSID library. Today, only a relatively limited subset of the current USSID inventory resides on
INTELINK, but an expanded INTELINK USSID library will be made available in coming weeks.
With this new library, access control via passwords will be instituted to protect USSIDs, which
can divulge a lot of critical information on SIGINT production processes and procedures.
(U//FOUO) The USSID Re-engineering Team continues to ensure that USSIDs are a useful
source of information for governing our distributed net-centric SIGINT architecture into the 21st
century.
