Today's buzzwords are voiced within NSA, but even more so, out in the tactical SIGINT<br>community. It is rare that these "in" words are NOT heard during any conference, briefing,<br>meeting, etc in the tactical SIGINT community today.Are these words thrown around just to<br>impress our stakeholders downtown and seek funding for a particular project, or are there really<br>efforts within the tactical community trying to achieve the concepts behind these words and<br>move toward a more collaborative, cohesive, tactical SIGINT enterprise?<br>(U//FOUO) The Airborne SIGINT Engineering Integrated Product Team (ASEIPT) is one effort<br>within the tactical SIGINT community that demonstrates true movement towards a more<br>collaborative, cohesive, tactical airborne SIGINT enterprise. In FY-02, the Defense and<br>Intelligence Authorization Conference Report stated that "ASD(C3I) should develop an<br>architectural plan to provide standards-based policy direction to the services, whose platform<br>program offices can develop systems and, to the maximum extent possible, share<br>developments." With two major tactical airborne SIGINT systems (Army's Arial Common Sensor<br>- ACS and Air Force's Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload - ASIP) on the doorstep of<br>development, Mr. John Stenbit, then ASD/C3I, responded to this report by establishing the<br>ASEIPT.<br>(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT consists of platform system engineers representing all the major<br>airborne tactical SIGINT platforms (ACS, Guardrail, EP-3, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance<br>(BAMS), Multi-Mission Aircraft (MMA), GLOBAL HAWK/ASIP, Rivet Joint, and U-2) as well as<br>NSA's Tactical Platform Division. NSA's National Tactical Integration Office (NTIO) is the<br>facilitator of this IPT (Integrated Process Team). The ASEIPT provides the forum for the services<br>to identify opportunities to collaboratively meet operational requirements while emphasizing<br>cross-platform re-usability and interoperability. Mr. Stenbit wants to foster true collaboration<br>between the services by using open systems architecture concepts in developing SIGINT<br>solutions once and extending them out amongst other tactical systems to the maximum extent<br>possible. Although it is not reasonable to expect a "one solution fits all" solution, sub-sets of<br>hardware, software, implementation standards, etc. may be leveraged across multiple service<br>SIGINT platforms.<br>(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT provided the avenue for the Army and Air Force to develop a joint open<br>system architecture baseline and the establishment of their relationship was formalized between<br>the two program offices. This collaboration has grown in importance with the Navy's decision to<br>adopt the ACS as its next generation tactical SIGINT platform (EP-3 replacement). We will now<br>have three Services working collaboratively to design next generation tactical airborne SIGINT<br>systems.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
