(U//FOUO) Don't Stand on Ceremony! -- Get to Know the SID Protocol
Team
FROM: the SID Protocol Team
Unknown
Run Date: 07/22/2005
(U//FOUO) Good day to everyone! We are the SID Protocol team and we would like to share with
you what protocol is and why it's necessary.
(U//FOUO) Of course, proper introductions are necessary before we can continue:
Janet M. Greer is the team leader. She joined the Agency in February 2004.
 is an "old timer" as she started in the Agency in 1987. She is the
resident protocol historian because she's been in protocol for 5 years.
 is a Protocol Officer who came to the Agency in April 2003. Prior to
joining NSA she worked in protocol at Ft. Eustis, Virginia for 10 years.

(U//FOUO) The SID Protocol Team officially reports to the NSA/CSS Protocol office , but is
forward-deployed to SID. The main mission of the team is to support and advise MG Quirk, Mr.
Meals, and Ms. Vice on forms of ceremony and etiquette for local, state, international formal and
informal events. These events include:
presidential, congressional, government agencies, corporate, foreign, and domestic
visits;
retirement and promotion ceremonies;
on-site and off-site conferences;
open houses and socials.
If the SID suite delegates are unavailable and transfer their responsibilities to another manager,
we still provide support. SID Protocol also gives guidance to anyone in SID who needs a protocol
question answered.
(U) Now you may be wondering, "What use is protocol? Why such troublesome and weird rules?"
The authors of The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage have a good
answer to this question:
"Any organization or society must, if it is to thrive, operate under certain rules if for no other
reason than to prevent chaos. The same applies to relations between governments. It is
necessary that contacts between nations be made according to universally accepted rules or
customs and some form of planned organization. That is protocol."
(U) Still want to hear more about how protocol works? Sure you do -- and there will be more to
come in upcoming SID today articles. If you have questions or concerns now about an event,
email the team at DL SDS_PROTOCOL or 
 or give us a call on 
.
We're here for you!
