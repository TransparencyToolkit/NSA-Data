(U//FOUO) What is the President's Daily Brief and How Does NSA
Participate?
FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 05/27/2005
(C) Each day in the early morning hours, a team of senior analysts leave CIA Headquarters to
deliver the President's Daily Brief (PDB) to the top US officials*. This brief contains the most
important and sensitive intelligence information available to the community. With the new
Director of National Intelligence, Ambassador John Negroponte, and Principal Deputy DNI,
General Michael Hayden, in place, the PDB is undergoing a dramatic transformation. NSA now
has the opportunity to become more involved then ever before in this important executive
support.
(C) Soon, the PDB and other executive-level intelligence publications will be produced in a more
evaluative and collaborative process, with contributions from across the Intelligence Community.
NSA and other IC agencies must each develop internal capabilities to engage and collaborate on
such publications as the PDB, the President's Terrorist Threat Report (PTTR) and the Senior
Executive Intelligence Bulletin (SEIB). For NSA this is a new role-- gradually moving from review
of how SIGINT is used in the PDB and other summaries to collaboration in drafting and possible
contribution of candidate items.
(C) The Strategic Intelligence Issues Office (S17) within the Customer Relationships Directorate
(CRD) has worked with offices throughout SID, IAD and NSOC to address NSA's support for
these publications. Two important steps are being taken:
1.  Senior NSA intelligence analysts will be integrated into the President's Analytic Support
Staff (PASS) and
2.  An NSA Executive Support Staff (ESS) is being created, comprised of intelligence officers
with SID and IAD experience. The ESS will review, edit and coordinate SIGINT-based
items included in IC publications; develop NSA's ability to draft original items; and enable
NSA to play a greater collaborative role at the national level.
(U//FOUO) Are you ready to become a part of the DNI Transition by joining the
President's Analytic Support Staff in the production of the President's Daily Brief?
(U//FOUO) NSA has been offered two possible positions on the PDB Production Staff:
The first is for a GG-15 senior intelligence analyst to become an editor on the President's
Analytic Support Staff for an 18-24 month assignment. This person would learn the
nuances of writing for the President and familiarize himself/herself with a wide range of
current issues. After six months of duty as an editor, the selectee would be considered for
a position as a briefer to one of the principals. This opportunity affords the individual a
rare chance to directly impact policy making at the highest level.
The second position, also an 18-24 month assignment, is for a dynamic, motivated GG13/14 intelligence analyst to act as NSA's DNI Production Officer, serving on an
interagency team and coordinating NSA's input to the PDB.
(U//FOUO) Both NSAers would work directly for Steve Kaplan, Chief of the President's Analytic
Support Staff at CIA and would work closely with the new NSA Executive Support Staff being
created in CRD. For the near-term this process will remain at CIA, with possible relocation at
some point to the DNI's new location. CRD is also looking for a small number of Intelligence
Analysts with editorial experience who would be interested in joining the NSA Executive Support
Staff.
(U//FOUO) If you are interested in applying for either of the PDB position or finding out more

 about opportunities on the NSA Executive Support Staff, please contact David Shore or Marilyn
Maines of the Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17) Leadership Team.

*(C) Those briefed at the PDB include the President, Vice President, Chief of Staff, National
Security Advisor, Deputy National Security Advisor, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense,
JCS Chairman, Vice-President's National Security Advisor and President's Assistant for Homeland
Security.
