First draft of SIGINT Information Management Strategy now available (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) The effectiveness of the SIGINT system in the future depends upon a fundamental
philosophical shift in our approach to information management. The shift must focus first and
foremost on the customer, analysis, and mission needs rather than the data types or
communication modes. Secondly, the shift must support the ability to automatically find, collect
and analyze communications from progressively more mobile and globally distributed
targets. The need for a clear set of information management principles to guide future
development activities is particularly acute with the move to a globally distributed operations
environment.
(U//FOUO) The Deputy Directors and Technical Directors of SID chartered a SIGINT
Information Management (SIM) team with members from S, S1, S2, S3, SIGDEV, and the
Information Technology Directorate (ITD) to create a strategy to address SIM holistically. The
team is developing an Information Management strategy that is in concert with the Layered
Zone Model to support all consumers of Knowledge, Information, and Data (KID), internal and
external, human and automated processing, with strategic guidance for the architecture, design,
development and deployment of modernized KID repositories. These strategic principles will
guide acquisition, processing, and consumption of SIGINT to meet customer needs.
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Information Management team has been working to develop an initial
draft set of information management principles. They have reviewed a wide variety of related
documents and are conducting interviews with key stakeholders in the future SIGINT system.
The team has organized strategic principles in the following areas:
Analytic and SIGDEV Interaction
Architecture
Command and Control
Data model
Distributed SIGINT system
Mission Assurance
Security/legal/auditing/sharing
(U//FOUO) An initial draft of the information management principles is now available at
the SIMT webpage: 
 . Employing a range
of techniques including online feedback, collaboration, and personal engagement, the team will
continue interviews, sponsor focus groups, refine the principles, and develop a strategic plan
forward. Watch for more news on the activities of the team, or visit our website.
