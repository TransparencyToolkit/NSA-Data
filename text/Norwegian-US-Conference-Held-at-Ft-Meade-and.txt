(S//SI) Norwegian-US Conference Held at Ft Meade and Colorado

Run Date: 07/07/2006

(S//SI) Conferees talk about SIGDEV Working Group projects, Norway's use of CENTER ICE in
Afghanistan, and ELINT collaboration.

(S//SI) The 2006 NORUSA Annual Planning Conference between NSA and the Norwegian
Intelligence Service (NIS) was held at NSA Headquarters from 3-5 April 2006. A final day at
NSA/CSS Colorado on 7 April brought the conference to a successful close.

(S//SI) Tom Rykken, Director of NIS's Technical Collection Division, led a delegation of six senior
managers representing the International Analysis, Technology and Operational Programs,
Collection, Regional Analysis, and Technical Support Sub-Divisions at NIS. Tom then led a
slightly smaller delegation to Denver.

(S//SI) The agenda for this year's conference featured briefings and discussions on topics as
diverse as the latest projects undertaken by the joint NSA/NIS SIGINT Development Working
Group (SIGDEV WG), the successes associated with Norway's use of CENTER ICE in Afghanistan,
and NSA/NIS collaboration on ELINT analysis.

(S//SI) Established in December 2004, the joint NSA/NIS SIGDEV WG initially focused on
increasing target exploitation against Russian Navy C4I* and advanced signals, the Russian
Ministry of Emergency Situations and its ties to counterterrorism and nuclear BW/CW/security*,
and HF Data Networks. Energized by the early successes of the SIGDEV WG, conference
participants committed to forming new joint teams to undertake future projects and further
analytic sharing. The new teams will work on CP and Russian Civil communications issues. The
recent transition of Norway's state-of-the-art FORNSAT facility ( VICTORY GARDEN ) to
operational status will help pave the way for NSA/NIS collaboration in these arenas. As VICTORY
GARDEN allows NIS to "see" 130 foreign satellites, we can expect that new intelligence
benefiting both partners will quickly rise in parallel with Norway's enhanced capabilities.

(S//SI) To their credit, and as noted early in the conference, the Norwegians have also
contributed significantly to multinational operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan this past year.

LTG Alexander pointed out in his opening remarks that Norway was the first coalition partner in
Afghanistan to use CENTER ICE - an information sharing system that includes a secure, tactical
communications system that connects coalition SIGINT units. (See related article .) Norway's
efforts with CENTER ICE set the standard for other coalition partners, and benefited not only US
troops stationed in Afghanistan, but also Canadian, British and Australian forces as well.

(S//SI) At the conclusion of the NSA HQ session, a slightly smaller delegation headed off for
Denver to meet with representatives of the Headquarters of the Global TECH SIGINT Enterprise
for the last day of the conference. During their visit, the NIS delegation was briefed on NSA/CSS
Colorado's capabilities and future direction. The NIS delegation also toured NSA mission areas

on the Operations Floor (Maritime Analysis Support Team, PROFORMA, and ELINT Unidentified
(EUI) areas). Of note, this delegation was the first Third Party to receive live demos at the
Interactive ELINT Processor position as well as Auto-HP, where processors receive, identify and
report ELINT signals.

(S//SI) Echoing themes raised earlier in the week, NORUSA conference participants commented
on the close collaboration between NIS ELINT analysts and Denver's National Technical ELINT
Center.	Chief Analysis and Production - Colorado, underscored the need to

share the workload and avoid duplication of effort with respect to the analysis of foreign radar
signals. As a result of their discussions, both sides agreed to establish direct connectivity
between NSA/NIS ELINT analysts to enhance cooperation.

(S//SI) After the conference ended, the NIS delegation and NSA/CSS Colorado leadership team
took in some sightseeing at Red Rocks. Located just outside Denver, Red Rocks offers a
beautiful collection of natural sandstone formations as well as a 9000-seat man-made
amphitheater. Dinner at the award-winning "The Fort" restaurant situated nearby, with its two-
feet-thick adobe walls, beamed ceilings, and mid-nineteenth century artifacts, capped the
evening off and gave our visitors some memories that they are not likely to soon forget!
