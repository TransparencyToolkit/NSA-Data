(TS//SI//NF) Special Source Operations-OAKSTAR program MONKEYROCKET, a non-
Western Internet anonymization service in support of counter-terrorism, achieved initial
operational capability on 19 July 2012. The system is now forwarding METADATA to
backend repositories (MARINA, cloud site storage) and is expected to begin forwarding
content to a NOFORN partition in PINWALE later this week following final coordination
and loading of Unified Tasking Tool tasking. This effort began in January and began
focused advertising in areas of interest to counter-terrorism in the April timeframe.
Currently, there are approximately 16,000 registered users, and the site is generating
about 2,000 events per day. These numbers are expected to grow significantly as new
users begin using the service. Iran and China are two of the countries with a significant
user base.
