SID today article in him"! For example, you could: Tell everyone about the important project
you are working on and how it will affect others... Describe an interesting TDY you made... Point
out a problem and suggest ways to fix it... Tell a success story... If you have an idea for a story,
use the "Submit an Item" box on the right-hand side of the SID today homepage. You may be
happy you did.
