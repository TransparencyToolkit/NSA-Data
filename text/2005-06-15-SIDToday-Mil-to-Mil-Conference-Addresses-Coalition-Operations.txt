(U) Mil-to-Mil Conference Addresses Coalition Operations
FROM: 
FAD's Multinational/Second Party Office (DP16)
Run Date: 06/15/2005

(C) The Office of Multinational and Second Party Affairs recently hosted the second Global
Military-to-Military Foreign Affairs Conference at NSAW. Over 70 SIGINT professionals
representing elements of the global SIGINT enterprise -- NSAW, NSA/CSS Hawaii, Georgia, and
Texas, US military commands and SCEs, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB - met to discuss militaryto-military foreign partnerships in general and coalition operations in particular.
(C) Charles Berlin, Deputy Director for Customer Relationships, provided the keynote address,
describing his vision of 21st Century SIGINT and Five Impediments to SIGINT Success. He also
challenged the participants to focus on the way forward towards the realization of the
conference's theme, " Coalition Operations - Success Through Collaboration ." On the second
day of the conference, Ambassador Hugh Montgomery, Special Assistant to the DCI for Foreign
Intelligence Relationships, outlined the " Changes in the Intelligence Paradigm ."
(U//FOUO) Conference presentations outlined "what worked" and "what didn't work" in SIGINT
coalition efforts supporting Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Perhaps
even more important than the briefings themselves were the candid discussions that followed.
Group consensus indicated the conference was definitely worthwhile and recommended it be
held annually, with the possibility of rotating host locations. For briefings, minutes, and
additional information on the conference, please refer to the conference website located on the
Foreign Affairs Directorate homepage.
