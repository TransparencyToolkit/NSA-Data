Just as I've talked about<br>how important it is for all of us on "team SIGINT" to "play position" ( See<br>related SID-All Message and recent SID Message of the Day ), it's equally imperative that we<br>have an overall game plan-- so we all know where we're headed and can play our positions<br>accordingly. The SIGINT strategy-- AKA the SID Placemat-- is that game plan. The latest update<br>of our strategy, the SIGINT Enterprise Strategy: FY 2003-2008, is now available on the SIGINT<br>Directorate Homepage ("go sigint") .<br>(U//FOUO) Please take the time to read the SIGINT Enterprise Strategy: FY 2003-2008 today.<br>Every one of us is integral to the success of the SIGINT system; ideally, everyone in SID will see<br>themselves in this strategy. We all own the strategy, the goals it sets forth, and its outcomes.<br>Remember, as you read it, that the strategy only sets a course for the future. It's in pursuing<br>our goals that we learn and discover-- changing, improving, and stressing the strategy along the<br>way. It's not what the strategy says so much as it is what it causes to happen in the hands of<br>brilliant people. Here's to discovery! (U//FOUO) Since the inception of the SID organization over<br>two years ago, we also have worked to develop measures to assess our progress against our<br>strategy. I will be working with the SIGINT Leadership Team to review our progress against the<br>SIGINT strategy regularly. The results of our performance reviews will be available via SIGINT<br>Directorate Homepage. Having all of our efforts aligned by mapping our P3s to the strategy will<br>help to assess our overall performance. In addition to aligning your own P3 objectives with the<br>plan, many of you also will be contributing performance measurement data for the SIGINT<br>Performance Reviews. I appreciate your commitment to "inspecting what we expect."<br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
