(U) Here's the first "monthly update" from SID's Deputy Directorate for Data Acquisition:
(U//FOUO) In the summer of 2005 many changes occurred within the Data Acquisition front
office. First and foremost, they relocated to the first floor of OPS 1 in Room 1N051 where they
joined the Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition, the staff, the DA Extended Enterprise
Team, the forward-deployed Registry team and the Strategy and Business Management
personnel.
(U//FOUO) In August,
 our Deputy Director, moved to an exciting new position
as the Deputy, Assistant Deputy Director for National Intelligence, Technical Means. We honored
 with an Open House on 7 September. I am sure we'll continue to see and witness
his wisdom and guidance on critical issues.
(U//FOUO) Replacing 
 as the Deputy Director, Data Acquisition is Mr. Jim Cusick. He
served as the Assistant Deputy Director for the past two and a half years and prior to that was
involved in a unique series of assignments, most recently as the NCR Defense. Mr. Cusick also
served overseas in the mid to late '80s. You can learn more about him by visiting the S3 Home

(U//FOUO) Joining the leadership team, as the Assistant Deputy Director Data Acquisition, is
Mr. Rick Ledgett , recently returned from Hawaii, where he was the NSA/CSS Representative
Pacific Command (NCPAC).
(U) Please take the opportunity to welcome both gentlemen to their new assignments.
