(U//FOUO) HR Update: Changes Affecting Foreign Language
Incentive Pay (FLIP)
FROM: 
Human Resource Service Center for SID (MD6)
Run Date: 10/04/2005
(U//FOUO) This is just a reminder that as of October 1, 2005 the new NSA/CSS testing policy,
Policy 4-5 , went into effect. The DLPT5 (Defense Language Proficiency Test) System was
introduced and PQE Part IIA and IIB was eliminated. As a result of the new policy, FLIP will be
paid for achieving level 3 as measured by the DLPT5 system (Multiple-Choice or Constructed
Response) or for passing Part I of the PQE.
(U//FOUO) If you have passed Part I of a PQE in a foreign language and you use that
language in your officially assigned duties, you may be eligible to begin receiving an
incentive. To initiate your biweekly FLIP, please ask your supervisor to complete the FLIP form
found at the FLIP change request website or "go FLIP" and send it to 
@nsa.
(U//FOUO) Once requests for FLIP are received and approved, they will become effective at the
beginning of the next appropriate pay period. For further information on the DLPT5 and NSA's
switch to the new system, see the:
October 24, 2004 article on NSA Daily and the DLPT5 webpage .
U//FOUO) If you have any questions, please contact MD6 .
