(S//SI) CT Staff and Augmentees Focus on Bombings in Britain
FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis & Production (S2)
Run Date: 10/27/2005

(U//FOUO) Augmentees from across SID finish up 90-day tour in CT.
(S//SI) We all hope that when our friends need us, we will be able to lend a hand. When three
terrorist bombs exploded on sovereign British soil on 7 July 2005, NSA was able to prove its
ability to come through for one of its allies. What did we do? We jumped right in. The
Counterterrorism Primary Production Center (CT PPC) diverted what resources it could to
support the bombings-related surge of activity, but it couldn't do it all alone. That's when 22
analysts from across the SIGINT Directorate augmented the CT mission with the express
purpose of exploiting data related to the London bombings.
(U//FOUO) For 90 days, these augmentees rose to the CT challenge, doing whatever was asked
of them. Side-by-side with "permanent" CT experts, they triaged, processed, analyzed and
reported huge volumes of information, seeking leads to the perpetrators and their backers.
These augmentees were a critical component of CT's efforts to support GCHQ and the British
community at large. This group of 22 analysts did a fabulous job! They are now returning to
their former positions with the knowledge that when times got tough... they got going! They left
not only with rich work experiences, but with the appreciation and admiration of their new CT
colleagues.
(S//SI) The surge related to the London bombings may have come and gone, but the global
terrorist threat is still very real. That's why the CT PPC was recently authorized a personnel plusup that has resulted in a lot of competitive selection vacancies. There are currently 29 vacancies
out there, for people with a wide variety of skills and a desire to be part of the CT Team.
(U//FOUO) To see more about the available positions and to help you apply, go to the
DANCEHALL/CVA database . There you can search for S2I available positions and get all the
details to apply online.
(U//FOUO) There is also a new search tool available on this page to help find the positions more
easily. Check it out. It will help you find the jobs you are interested in and let you tell us about
the skills that you have. We need you!
