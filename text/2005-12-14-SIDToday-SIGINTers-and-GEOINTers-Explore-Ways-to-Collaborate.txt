(U//FOUO) SIGINTers and GEOINTers Explore Ways to Collaborate
FROM: 
CSRC's Office of Partnerships and Strategic Issues (S3C1)
Run Date: 12/14/2005

(U//FOUO) The collection organizations of SID and NGA see benefits in working together.
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Directorate's Data Acquisition (DA, S3) hosted the first NSA Data
Acquisition and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) SOURCE Information Exchange at
NSA on 17 October 2005. NGA's Source Directorate mission is to discover, acquire, and deliver
all the data and information used to create Geospatial Intelligence.
(U//FOUO) Leadership representatives from both DA and SOURCE met to achieve greater
understanding of the capabilities of each organization, and to increase networking and
collaborative opportunities between Data Acquisition and SOURCE, which will ultimately
strengthen intelligence collection for our nation's security.
(U//FOUO) The Intelligence Community (IC) has long recognized the critical need for much
greater "horizontal integration" of operations among the various intelligence disciplines and
between the IC and its partners. The collaboration between NSA and NGA is just one example of
NSA's quick response to this need. An NGA liaison, 
 has worked with the CRSC
strategy division since 2003, and in 2005 that collaboration was broadened to include a senior
CSRC representative, Peter Rowley, at NGA.
(U//FOUO) The event included overview briefings on both DA and SOURCE missions and an
example of a success story demonstrating how combining GEOINT and SIGINT can solve
seemingly intractable intelligence problems. Both groups articulated the value of this meeting
and indicated that further exchanges of information and contacts will continue.
