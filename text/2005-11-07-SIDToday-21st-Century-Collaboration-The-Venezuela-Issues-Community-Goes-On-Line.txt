(S//SI) 21st Century Collaboration: The 'Venezuela Issues
Community' Goes On-Line
FROM:
SINIO for Latin America (S17)
Run Date: 11/07/2005
(S//SI) Intelligence analysts now have a new forum for interacting with their peers: a computerbased "issues community" that makes sharing information easy. How did it come to be? In late
September 2005, LTG Alexander directed S17 to harness the power of wiki and blog technology
to allow SIGINT'ers, our Intelligence Community partners and customers to collaborate more
effectively. The Venezuela Issues Community on the NSA Corporate Server, also referred to as
ESECS**, is a first step in that direction. In addition to a blog capability, the Community
includes folders where background and related papers, briefings, and other information can be
stored and accessed by members of the Community. A calendar and task management tools also
are featured.
(S//SI) The SINIO for Latin America is tasked with "governing" the Community; that is,
overseeing the content management and ensuring that analysts and others working Venezuela
or related targets are encouraged to participate. We envision this community including
analysts and linguists from across the NSA Enterprise, across SID, across Production
Lines, and across disciplines whose work touches on some aspect of Venezuela on a
regular basis. Acquiring an account is an easy process. Simply:
type "go esecs" in the URL line on NSANET,
type in your PKI password,
click on the "request account" button on the top right-hand side of the Corporate Server
web page, and
list the Venezuela Issues Community as one you would like to join!
(S//SI) The Venezuela Issues Community can serve as a means of engaging analysts on
important intelligence questions, especially those in which SIGINT is a key source of information.
We hope to harness the analytical exchanges and perspectives and share the collaboration as
formal SIGINT Assessment Reports.
(S//SI) To kick off this initiative, the SINIO, in collaboration with the SIGINT Assessments Cell,
is looking at a couple of key intelligence questions:
How has the Venezuelan military changed in response to Cuban influence?
How do recent Venezuelan military exercises reflect Cuban influence on the Venezuelan
military?
We invite all analysts, linguists, and managers working Venezuela to participate in
this effort, which will be held in the Venezuela Issues Community on the corporate server from
7 to 21 November.
