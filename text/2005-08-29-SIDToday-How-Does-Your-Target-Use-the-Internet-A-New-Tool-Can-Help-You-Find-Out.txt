(S//SI) How Does Your Target Use the Internet? A New Tool Can Help
You Find Out
FROM:
NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC)
Run Date: 08/29/2005
(S//SI) Do you manually research your targets using the Internet? How confident are you that
you have a complete and up-to-date picture of how your target accesses the Internet? Are you
aware that there is a new tool that can help speed those tasks, providing a more complete
picture of your target's Internet access as well as Autonomous System (AS-to-AS) connectivity?
(S//SI) DNOC Spiral II is a cutting-edge tool that merges open source, commercial, and
SIGINT data to provide a daily model of the internet as well as incorporating change-detection at
multiple levels of detail, provided by NTOC's Autonomous System Modeling and Change
Detection organization (V11).
(S//SI) NTOC V11 philosophy:
Provide the SIGINT community, in a rapid and efficient manner, the best possible information
describing targeted-data networks.
Find, develop, and utilize any source that can help us achieve our above mission statement.
(S//SI) Current capabilities:
Consistent, daily import of open source & SIGINT data
Customer interface to enable AS-level network analysis
Supports exploration of data networks over time: daily AS-level network models stored
for 30 days
Provides initial change detection capability: automated checks of new data against
targeted data networks
Begins to overlay SIGINT collection points on the logical AS level network map: To
improve the efficiency of our collection assets get the desired info at the right place the
first time
Begins development of AS level IP-IP paths
(S//SI) Possible uses:
Find new inbound and outbound links for a network.
Find new paths of data that were previously hidden from open source research.
Steer SIGINT towards links with higher intelligence potential, optimizing collection
resources.
Track target movement at the country level.
Map DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) communication paths between targets.
Accelerate the process of identifying changes in a target's network.
(S//SI) Future developments to allow for "drill-down" ability within AS of interest.
