I would like to underscore that<br>SID is fully committed to this idea-- it is the right of every SID employee to receive thoughtful<br>and timely feedback from management on his or her performance, including one's standing for<br>possible promotion.<br>(U) Some may not be aware that the current process is about more than just promotions-- it<br>includes a range of awards for excellent performance, including monetary awards (such as<br>Quality Step Increases and Special Achievement Awards) and non-monetary awards (honorary<br>awards, time-off awards, etc.). We cannot promote everyone who is deserving--there are many<br>outstanding performers in SID and a finite number of promotions--but we do have other ways of<br>recognizing great work. We have committed a minimum of 50% of our award money to this<br>promotion cycle. Managers are looking at people's performance and potential, keeping in mind<br>SID's promotion and award dollars.<br>(U) While managers have a duty to provide productive feedback, there is also an employee's<br>responsibility to accept feedback well. Feedback is a two-way street-- listen to your manager<br>and try to understand what it is you must do to excel in the future. Our Workforce Management<br>Executive, <br>, has a booklet, Ongoing Feedback: How to Get It, How to Use It ,<br>that might be helpful to you; please contact her if you would like one.<br>(U) MG Quirk and Charlie Meals view the workforce as the "top and bottom line" in SID-- they<br>are committed to a fair promotion and award system. Let's do our best to contribute to the<br>success of this process.<br>(U) The below resources are available to help managers provide effective feedback:<br>Performance Management Info for Raters and Mr. Bruce Tulgan's Employee Feedback<br>video<br>Tulgan's FAST Feedback system, including training tools<br>Perhaps the handiest guide is an easy-to-follow, condensed working aid of all the Tulgan<br>materials.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
