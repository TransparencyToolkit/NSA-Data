(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce
another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe
these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are
interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities. Advance Registration is
required; see instructions below.
(C//SI) The discovery and collection of all of an important target's communications require the
deployment of a strategy through which strong selectors applied against metadata-rich
technologies and accesses are used to tip off other technologies and accesses. Metadata analysis
will yield target discovery and new more powerful strong selectors. Critical components of this
distributed collection approach include identifying a particular target's communications, tipping
between accesses, associating many aggregate session parts, and presenting all of a target's
communications to the analyst via a single workstation and viewer.
(C//SI) After an overview and status of PSC, the discussion will focus on PSC challenges. The
overview will outline how PSC integrates with other SSG initiatives such as the implementation of
SID's Metadata Strategy (CONDENSER), the Master Association Manager (MAM), the Unified
Targeting Tool (UTT), and GLOBALVISION. Additionally, relationships to external programs such
as CT Production, the Persona Pod (#38), TURBULANCE, TRAFFICTHIEF, WEALTHYCLUSTER 2.0,
X-KEYSCORE, UIS, and content repositories will also be addressed.
