(U) What's SID's High School Work-Study Program All About?
FROM:
SID Human Resources Service Center (MD6)
Run Date: 11/01/2005

(U) Students "learn the ropes" of employment at NSA...
(U) What do participants get out of SID's High School Work-Study Program? For the students, it
is an opportunity to get training and real-world job experience, as well as a "foot in the door" for
possible future employment at NSA. (Well, there's also the income!) How does it benefit SID?
Since the students work on a part-time, temporary basis, they fill a niche by performing tasks
that do not demand a permanent billet. SID also gets the opportunity to groom talented youth
for careers at NSA.
(U) The HSWS Program provides the trainee with skills that will qualify him/her for a position at
the normal entry level of the Agency. To qualify for the program, the candidate must:
Be a high school Junior;
Be enrolled in either Business Computers or Office Technology classes;
Have plans to take part in a school sponsored work experience program during their
Senior school year;
Carry an overall "B" GPA; and
Be 16 years of age by August 31st following their Junior year
(U) Positions open to Work Experience Students ...
Clerical Assistant (type, file, maintain records, answer phones and operate business
equipment such as word processors and personal computers); and
Computer Aides (operate data processing equipment, often the most sophisticated
equipment in the market)
(U) When hired, employment is guaranteed from September to June of the participant's senior
year, with the possibility an extension through August 31st. The temporary part-time
employment category requires a Monday-Friday duty schedule for no more than 32 hours, and
no less than 20 hours per week. The participant's wage is consistent with a GGD-01 job
classification.
(U//FOUO) The agency currently has 158 work-studies and 59 of those are in SID. There were
128 in the graduating class of 2005 and 42 of those were converted to full- and part-time
positions.
