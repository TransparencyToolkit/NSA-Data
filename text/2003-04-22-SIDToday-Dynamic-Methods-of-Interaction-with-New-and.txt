DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Dynamic Methods of Interaction with New and Existing Customers<br>FROM:<br>Acting Chief, Customer Gateway<br>Run Date: 04/22/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Nothing has changed the face of our nation like the<br>terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Those attacks, the war in<br>Iraq, and the crisis in North Korea have also changed the faces and<br>the needs of most of our customers and partners. World events<br>created new customers and changed the roles of others in ways<br>that we could not have imagined. Yet, the Signals Intelligence<br>Directorate (SID) already had the framework in place in the<br>Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) to absorb and respond<br>to this tidal wave of change.<br>(S//SI) In the Customer Gateway, NSA's External Representatives<br>who are integrated at customer agencies joined hands with Senior<br>Executive Account Managers (SEAMs), Account Managers (AMs),<br>National Cryptologic Representatives (NCRs), SIGINT National<br>Intelligence Officers (SINIOs), and Product Line Leaders to produce<br>new profiles of our customers' needs. Those profiles, captured in<br>Customer Support Plans , provide a detailed blueprint for what<br>intelligence each customer needs as well as the preferred method<br>of dissemination.<br>(S//SI) Customers such as the Department of Interior and the<br>Department of Agriculture, whom we considered to be in a<br>"caretaker" status before 11 September, suddenly became<br>voracious consumers of SIGINT. The NSA Representative, who had<br>been servicing these accounts with a weekly visit to analysts at<br>those locations, suddenly received the access to brief the<br>Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior multiple times weekly.<br>Similarly, completely new customers appeared - U.S. Northern<br>Command (NORTHCOM) , the Federal Reserve, and the Missile<br>Defense Agency. Other new customers, such as the Department of<br>Homeland Security, created a ripple effect on demand for SID<br>products and services among existing customers absorbed into<br>that organization such as U.S. Customs, the Immigration and<br>Naturalization Service (INS), and the U.S. Secret Service. Existing<br>customers, such as U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), also<br>absorbed other organizations and missions (U.S. Space<br>Command/SPACECOM), underlining our need to be flexible in<br>responding to customer needs.<br>(S//SI) The increasingly critical role of intelligence in supporting<br>the Law Enforcement Community has prompted both the Federal<br>Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and<br>Firearms to create Intelligence Directorates that will dramatically<br>alter interactions with the Intelligence Community, particularly<br>when the Terrorist Threat Integration Center reaches full<br>operational capability.<br>(S//SI) Our customers have challenged us to change with them,<br>anticipate their needs, and collaborate with them on the way<br>ahead. In that spirit, Customer Response has several new and<br>dynamic dissemination products coming to "market" that include:<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Customer Relations<br>1.  When Meeting<br>Customer Needs<br>Means Defending the<br>Nation<br>2.  Information Needs<br>Management: Careful<br>Planning Aids SIGINT<br>Response to Iraq<br>War<br>3.  Dynamic Methods of<br>Interaction with New<br>and Existing<br>Customers<br>4.  A Perspective on the<br>NSA/ USUN<br>Partnership<br>5.  Making Customer<br>Feedback Work for<br>Everyone<br><br> </p>SECRET Over-the Internet --Particularly attractive to Law<br>Enforcement--a cross-organizational effort to provide<br>SECRET-level data to an unclassified workstation, in a nonSCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) area,<br>over the commercial Internet. The destination workstation<br>would remain unclassified.<br>Wireless Dissemination - Cell phones, pagers and<br>personal digital assistants are increasingly becoming the<br>tools of choice for information exchange for our Customers.<br>S12 Products and Services Futures continues the initiative<br>to disseminate Secret-level information to this set of<br>wireless devices.<br>SIGINT on DEMAND (SOD) - SOD is a web-based tool<br>that allows customers access to intelligence "snippets" prior<br>to the release of a full report. SOD allows customers to<br>view these snippets directly from their workstations via<br>direct e-mail, or through Intelink. Although still in<br>development, many NSA customers access information via<br>SOD everyday.<br>E Notebook - Printed and manual distribution of NSA<br>product remains the primary dissemination vehicle for some<br>customers. For example, the product pull, sort, collate and<br>manual delivery at the Pentagon involves up to eight<br>employees and reams of paper. Customer Response has<br>developed the technology to store the serialized product<br>retrieved from ANCHORY on a compact flash card. The<br>compact flash card can be read and displayed (after user<br>authentication) on an "E-notebook" or "Tablet PC." The Enotebook can remain in customer offices, and product<br>delivery is accomplished via the compact flash card (vice a<br>large stack of paper.)<br>(S//SI) The challenges facing SID in responding to change of this<br>magnitude will only increase. Managing customer relationships<br>successfully now requires an underlying structure that builds<br>confidence with the customer and within the workforce that issues<br>will be worked to resolution. That structure will be described in the<br>conclusion of our series.<br>(U//FOUO) We hope you continue to read the articles in this series<br>and, again, urge you to contact<br> Customer Gateway<br>Chief of Staff, S11, <br>, <br>@nsa, with any comments<br>or suggestions.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
