Netscape, Explorer, or Mozilla? An update on web browser availability in SID (U//FOUO)
Â·(U//FOUO) The most current desktop software loads for both Solaris and Windows
workstations come equipped with Netscape 4.7 as the default browser. Additionally, the
current Windows load also contains Internet Explorer 5.5.
(U//FOUO) In addition to having Netscape 4.7 on your workstation by default, there are
several web browsers currently available for "post-load" installation on both platforms via
a remedy ticket:
-- On the most current version of the Solaris platform ( version 8 of the OS), both
Netscape 7.0 and Mozilla 1.6 are available. It should be noted that Netscape 7.0 for
Solaris goes into the "avoid" state on the NES baseline after March 31, 2005 in favor of
Mozilla 1.6.
-- On older Solaris platforms ( version 2.6 of the OS), Mozilla 1.1 is available.
-- On all Windows platforms, Netscape 7.02 is available.
The forthcoming new Windows desktop load (version 6.0 -- to be released for use very
soon) will include Internet Explorer 6.0 as the default browser. Netscape 7.02 will remain
available for post loading on this system via a remedy ticket request.
(U//FOUO) As a result of GROUNDBREAKER modernization and the SID Desktop
Migration/Modernization Program, approximately 82% of the corporately supported desktops in
SID are now capable of running a modern web browser (either Netscape 7, Mozilla 1.6 or
Internet Explorer). The remaining workstations are mostly older Solaris machines that must use
either Netscape 4.7 or Mozilla 1.1 (the bulk of these are in S2). These older machines are
currently being migrated/modernized. While waiting for their workstation to be
migrated/modernized, users of these older machines may temporarily be able to use a modern
web browser through remote access. Contact 
 (
) for details.
