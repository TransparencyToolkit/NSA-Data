FROM: 
Intelligence Security Issues (S02L3)
Run Date: 04/13/2005

(U//FOUO) In the past year have you, individually or working with a team, contributed to efforts
identifying adversarial use of Denial & Deception (D&D) tactics to thwart the SIGINT system? If
so, then you may be eligible for a prestigious Intelligence Community award recognizing
such efforts. You are invited to submit nominations for the Foreign Denial and Deception
Committee's tenth annual D&D awards. Presentations will be made at the D&D awards
ceremony scheduled for 26 October 2005 in the CIA Headquarters Auditorium.
(U//FOUO) The ceremony will be held at the SECRET/NOFORN level. Last year over 100
government and contractor individuals, teams, and units from within the Intelligence Community
were recognized. It is certain that this year, as in years past, there are many award candidates
here at NSA.
(U//FOUO) The awards are intended to cover work substantially completed from June 2004 to
the present. The type of accomplishments recognized can vary greatly. Principally, nominees
must have developed a successful strategy or program to overcome adversarial denial and
deception efforts in the areas of: analysis, collection, research and development, training and
education, or counterintelligence and security. Anyone is welcome to submit a nomination for an
individual or team effort.
