Summary

In this problem book we set out areas for long-term data mining research at the Heilbronn
Institute for Mathematical Research starting in October 2011 and continuing for at least three
years. The four areas are beyond supervised learning, information flow in graphs, streaming
exploratory data analysis and streaming expiring graphs.

1	Introduction

The Government Office for Science reviewed GCHQ technology research in 2010 and identified
that we could lengthen our technology research horizon. The Heilbronn Institute for Mathemat-
ical Research (HIMR) had shown its mettle during a one-off graph mining workshop [I60, W42]
and thus the idea to more permanently expand HIMR research beyond pure maths and into
data mining was born. This also fits into GCHQ’s overall research and innovation strategy for
the next few years [I75], where engagement with academia via HIMR is a key plank.

Like many organisations, GCHQ is having to approach the “Big Data” problem. After
reviewing our current research we identified four broad areas for long-term research in math-
ematics and algorithms at HIMR. All of the four problem areas are about improving our
understanding of large datasets:

Beyond supervised learning: Can we use semi-supervised learning and related techniques
to improve the use of machine learning techniques?

Information flow in graphs: Can we identify information flowing across a communications
graph, typically from timing patterns alone?

Streaming exploratory data analysis: Can we develop new techniques for understanding
and visualising streaming data?

Streaming expiring graphs: Can we efficiently maintain current situational awareness of a
streaming expiring graph?

HIMR researchers are free to devote their effort amongst these problems as they see fit during
their classified time.

These problems have been chosen due to their SIGINT relevance and SIGINT data is
provided for all these problems. However we also recognise that these problems have overlaps
with current academic research areas. Thus, conditional on security considerations, HIMR
researchers should be able to generalise from classified research to unclassified research and
publications during their unclassified time.

Data is made available to HIMR researchers in the following forms:

Streams: GCHQ are prototyping the use of the DISTILLERY streaming architecture (see
Appendix B for details). Many data analysis problems can be efficiently approached in
the stream [E39] and processing in the stream brings the advantages of live situational
awareness and the potential to reduce follow-on storage and processing costs.

MapReduce: GCHQ store recent communications meta-data as distributed text files in Ha-
doop clusters which can then be processed with MapReduce [E10] (see Appendix C for
details). This environment will allow researchers to use large datasets typically spanning
the last six months of collection.

Reference: We also provide some smaller datasets (e.g. reference data or data that has already
been processed or truthed) as text files.

The development of techniques in Hadoop or DISTILLERY is recommended as that will enable
easy technology transfer from HIMR into GCHQ.

The HIMR Deputy Director, the authors of this problem book and members of GCHQ’s
Information and Communications Technology Research (ICTR) business unit should be seen
as the primary points-of-contact for this research. However we will also identify various other
areas for classified collaboration both in GCHQ and abroad.

GCHQ imagines that the most useful outcomes of this research will come in one of the
following forms:

•	Classified or unclassified research papers describing new techniques (or in limited cases a
literature review of existing techniques).

•	Classified research papers describing new or existing techniques applied to SIGINT data.

•	New analytics (typically in Hadoop or DISTILLERY) and documentation.

In this problem book we adopt two conventions:

•	We distinguish between references to internal literature, external literature and websites.
Citations are prefixed “I”, “E” and “W” respectively. Where possible literature is made
available in DISCOVER (see appendix D). We have deliberately aimed to be more com-
prehensive in citing internal literature than external literature; external references should
be easier to find from citation paths and review papers.

•	We highlight problems with a ◄ in the right-hand margin.

In the interests of brevity, this problem book does not give full definitions for all terms in use
in GCHQ and the use of GCWiki [W15] is a good place to find out more.

We would like to thank the many people across the 5-eyes community who have helped
us with the problem book, both in formal contributions and in informal discussions at various
conferences and visits over the last year. Within GCHQ we have had plenty of support from
members of ICTR (in particular	and	and PTD (in particular

).

We start the problem book with an overview of relevant SIGINT background before describ-
ing the problems in detail. In appendices we suggest some ways of working, describe GCHQ’s
implementations of Hadoop and DISTILLERY and describe the datasets available.

2	A brief introduction to SIGINT

This is a very brief, high-level overview for people unfamiliar with the SIGINT system, focused
on what data miners need to know about the data available to them and how data mining can
be applied to problems in target discovery and cyber. Researchers are encouraged to find out
more by browsing GCWiki and asking questions that arise.

SIGINT is intelligence derived from intercepted signals. Although this encompasses a huge
variety of emanations, we are principally concerned with COMINT: intercepted communica-
tions.

Parliament’s Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) formulates a set of priorities and require-
ments for intelligence on various topics, which GCHQ tries to meet by producing End Product
Reports (EPR) based on intercepted communications. GCHQ has the legal authority to inter-
cept communications for the specific purposes of safeguarding the UK’s national security and
economic well-being, and to prevent and detect serious crime. GCHQ always acts in accordance
with UK law. All researchers who have access to SIGINT data will be given legalities training,
and there is also some information in appendix E on how data should be handled.

2.1	Passive SIGINT

This section looks at some of the main stages in the ‘intelligence cycle’: how data gets collected,
processed and analysed to produce reports for GCHQ’s customers.

2.1.1	Collection

There are many ways of communicating, and consequently there are many sources of SIGINT
data. Traditionally, we collect signals using a variety of masts and dishes to pick up radio
or satellite signals. Increasingly, we are interested in network communications (phone calls or
internet traffic), and in this case to intercept the communication we usually need an access point
in the network. (Sometimes network data passes over a satellite link where we can pick it up—
COMSAT collection—but more often it doesn’t.) Collection of this network communication
data is called Special Source collection, the details of which are covered by ECIs. Access to raw
data collected from Special Source is protected by a COI called CHORDAL. Some information
about what the underlying sensitivities are, and the processes we have in place to protect them,
is provided in the CHORDAL briefing.

One final twist is that a UK service provider can be compelled by a warrant signed by the
Home Secretary or the Foreign Secretary to provide us with the communications data for a
specific line or account for a specified time. This goes by several names: Lawful Intercept (LI),
warranted collection, and PRESTON.

We refer to a single internet link as a bearer. We collect data from a bearer using a probe,
and our current technology can collect from a 10G bearer (i.e. a 10 gigabit-per-second link).
When a bearer is connected to a probe and associated processing equipment we describe the
bearer as being on cover. We have been building up our sustained collection of 10G bearers
since about 2008, and we now have approximately 200 bearers on sustained cover, spread across
Cheltenham, Bude and LECKWITH. We refer to these three sites as processing centres ; they
are abbreviated to CPC, RPC-1 and OPC-1 respectively.

We have access to many more bearers than we can have on cover at any one time, and the
set we have on cover is changed to meet operational needs.1 As well as the fact that bearers get
taken on and off, it is not unusual for technical problems to interrupt processing from a bearer,
both for short and prolonged periods. This means that one must be careful about making
assumptions about how traffic volumes from a given end-point vary over time: see [I10] for a
detailed discussion of the problem and one way to deal with it.

2.1.2	Processing

A 10G bearer produces a phenomenal amount of data: far too much to store, or even to process
in any complicated way. Our way of dealing with this is a multi-component system called MVR
(massive volume reduction). To make things manageable, the first step is to discard the vast
majority of the packets we see. This is accomplished by the Packet Processing Framework
(PPF), a software framework allowing a very limited set of matching operations to be run on
specialized hardware; packets that hit on these matches are then passed back to the software
layer, where more complicated processing (including sessionization, done by a platform called
TERRAIN) can be performed on the selected subset of the data.

Collected data falls into two categories: metadata and content. Roughly, metadata comes
from the part of the signal needed to set up the communication, and content is everything
else. For telephony, this is simple: the originating and destination phone numbers are the
metadata, and the voice cut is the content. Internet communications are more complicated,
and we lean on legal and policy interpretations that are not always intuitive. For example,
in an HTTP request, the destination server name is metadata (because it, or rather its IP
address, is needed to transmit the packet), whereas the path-name part of the destination URI
is considered content, as it is included inside the packet payload (usually after the string GET
or POST). For an email, the to, from, cc and bcc headers are metadata (all used to address the
communication), but other headers (in particular, the subject line) are content; of course, the
body of the email is also content.

There are extremely stringent legal and policy constraints on what we can do with content,
but we are much freer in how we can store and use metadata. Moreover, there is obviously a
much higher volume of content than metadata. For these reasons, metadata feeds will usually
be unselected—we pull everything we see; on the other hand, we generally only process content
that we have a good reason to target.2 GCHQ’s targeting database is called BROAD OAK,
and it provides selectors that the front-end processing systems can look for to decide when
to process content. Examples of selectors might be telephone numbers, email addresses or IP
ranges. A selector whose communications are currently being targeted is said to be on cover.

Metadata generally gives us information that we think of as events (‘A communicated with
B at time t’), and this terminology filters through into the name for the corporate processing
and storage system for 10G bearers: Next Generation Events (NGE).

xIn order to make decisions about which bearers to place on cover, we carry out a cyclic survey of all bearers.
Each bearer is connected to a probe for 15 minutes and data collected about the traffic seen during that time.
This is stored in the Flexible-survey Knowledge Base or FKB.

2We do collect some unselected content for survey and research purposes, but the requirements that our
activities be necessary and proportionate strictly limit what we can do with full-take content and who can have
access to it: in particular, analysts are not usually allowed to write reports based on it.

Once packets (or files or sessions created by assembling multiple packets) have been selected
and they emerge from MVR, they go to several different places.

•	Content databases. Traditional relational databases are still the ultimate point of rest
for corporate content data. There are also some legacy events database stores; soon, all
of GCHQ’s events processing and storage will move to the systems described in the next
three bullets.

•	QFDs. Query-focused datasets (QFDs) pick out data and store it in a way that makes
it easy to answer particular questions. For example, FIVE ALIVE is a dataset with a
record for each IP event seen, consisting of the 5-tuple (timestamp, source IP, source
port, destination IP, destination port) plus some information on session length and size.
This lets us answer questions about the network activity of a specific IP address.3

•	DISTILLERY. A stream processing platform enabling near real time processing of data.
See appendix B.

•	The cloud. A scalable distributed filesystem along with a MapReduce processing frame-
work. See appendix C.

It is important to emphasize that even after MVR, the data volumes in the QFDs, cloud
and DISTILLERY are still vast, and we don’t want to ship everything back to Cheltenham.
Everything is distributed across the processing centres, with limited amounts of information
being sent between them: queries to the stored data are all federated to the separate processing
centres, with only the results being sent back to Cheltenham and the analyst’s desktop.

2.1.3	Analysis, reporting and target development

Traditionally, an analyst would be given a particular target set to look at, and his or her aim
would be to use the communications of these targets to write reports answering questions of
interest to policymakers. For example, the target might be the Ruritanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MFA), and the aim to understand their posture in forthcoming negotiations with the
UK; or it might be Kawastan’s air force, and the aim to understand their general intentions
and specific movements in a region where UK forces are currently deployed. The point is that
the target set is generally well understood, and while looking at the contacts of a known senior
figure in the MFA might reveal other government ministers or officials worth targeting, the
problem essentially involves analysing communications carefully selected to be likely to bear
on the questions under consideration.

Counter-terrorism, and to a lesser extent increased work on serious crime, has changed
this landscape dramatically. The failure of the security services to prevent the 9/11 and 7/7
attacks has been widely dissected, both in the press and in government inquiries here and in
the US. Targets are no longer neatly identified by their affiliation to a foreign MFA, military, or
intelligence organization: finding the targets in the first place is now one of the most important
problems facing analysts, before they can even begin to assess their plans and intentions.

Contact chaining is the single most common method used for target discovery. Starting
from a seed selector (perhaps obtained from HUMINT), by looking at the people whom the seed
communicates with, and the people they in turn communicate with (the 2-out neighbourhood
from the seed), the analyst begins a painstaking process of assembling information about a
terrorist cell or network.

But what about those who simply are not on our radar at all, like the 7/7 bombers? The
main driver in target discovery has been to look for known modus operandi (MOs): if we have
seen a group of targets behave in a deliberate and unusual way, we might want to look for
other people doing the same thing. For this reason, a whole tranche of problems in this book
looks at ways of picking out behaviour matching a specific MO in a large dataset. Specific MOs
should be treated as particularly sensitive; knowledge of MOs can give SIGINT the edge over
our targets who wish to remain undiscovered.

For example, sometimes targets will buy separate mobile phones and only use them to speak
to each other, believing this to be good OpSec. In fact, this is unusual behavior that makes
them stand out. Analysts call these closed loops; to a mathematician looking at a telephony
graph, they are small components disconnected from the giant component that always forms in
communications graphs. Another example is the use of payphones (commonly called telephone
kiosks or TKs), which are an obvious way to communicate anonymously. Looking for calling
patterns between TKs, or between a TK in the UK and a number in (let us say) Pakistan, has
provided valuable intelligence leads.

Many of the problems in this book invite you to find new ways to use the data we have to
discover things that analysts either could never find by themselves, or would never have the
time to find in practice. It is important to point out that tolerance for false positives is very
low: if an analyst is presented with three leads to look at, one of which is probably of interest,
then they might have the time to follow that up. If they get a list of three hundred, five of
which are probably of interest, then that is not much use to them.

Once we have targets, clustering or community detection algorithms give us a way to expand
them into cells without laborious work by analysts. Doing this reliably and at scale is another
fundamental challenge presented in this problem book.

It is also worth saying that techniques developed for counter-terrorism analysis can also
feed back into traditional diplomatic and military analysis. For example, DynamicGraph (see
section 6) is a way to visualize communication events around a seed set. Many of the ap-
plications have been to counter-terrorism operations, but it was first developed to look at the
communications of foreign government officials visiting London for a G20 summit in 2009 [W18].

2.2	Computer network operations and the cyber mission

2.2.1	Cyber

Traditional diplomatic and military theories imagine nation states engaging in various physical
domains: land, sea, air and space. The cyber domain is an increasingly important new site for
interactions between states, and will only become more so as time goes on. The UK government
has recognized the critical importance of cyber to our strategic position: in the Comprehensive
Spending Review of 2010, it allocated a significant amount of new money to cyber, at a time
when almost everything else was cut. Much of this investment will be entrusted to GCHQ, and

in return it is imperative for us to use that money for the UK’s advantage.

Some of the problems in this book look at ways of leveraging GCHQ’s passive SIGINT
capabilities to give us a cyber edge, but researchers should always be on the look-out for
opportunities to advance the cyber agenda.

This section briefly discusses how sophisticated state actors (including ourselves and our
five-eyes partners) currently conduct themselves in cyberspace. It is important to bear in mind
that other states, in particular Russia and China, are not bound by the same legal framework
and ideas of necessity and proportionality that we impose on ourselves. Moreover, there are
many other malicious actors in cyberspace, including criminals and hackers (sometimes motiv-
ated by ideology, sometimes just doing it for fun, and sometimes tied more or less closely to a
nation state). We certainly cannot ignore these non-state actors.

2.2.2	Attack, exploit, defend, counter

There are four basic postures an actor can take in computer network operations (CNO).4

•	Attack. This is obviously the most directly aggressive approach. It is commonly referred
to as computer network attack (CNA); at GCHQ, one also hears it called effects. The actor
accesses an adversary’s network and deletes his files, destroys his network connectivity, or
causes other damage or inconvenience. There has been a lot of discussion, both internally
and externally, about the possibility of a cyber-based attack that could cause physical
damage beyond the network, for example by shutting down a power station.

•	Exploit. GCHQ’s first CNE (computer network exploitation) operation was carried out
in the early nineties, and since then CNE has grown to the scale of a small industry
in GCHQ. A typical operation involves establishing a long-term covert presence (an im-
plant ) on a target computer, which sends back (‘exfiltrates’) useful information over an
extended time period. You will know from press reports and public statements by the
head of Security Service that UK networks and those of our allies—both government and
commercial networks—are in turn routinely targeted by other countries.

•	Defend. CESG is responsible for protecting UK networks (primarily government net-
works, but the security of banks or other companies operating in the UK is also important
for economic well-being) from hostile CNA or CNE activity—the acronym for this is CND,
or computer network defence. It is important to be able to prevent attacks by rejecting
malicious packets at sensors or firewalls, and to understand who is attacking us (the
attribution problem), why, and what they are looking for.

•	Counter. This is a relatively new approach for GCHQ, which might better be called
active defence. As we come to understand the CNE infrastructure of a hostile actor, we
can target that infrastructure and attack it, disrupt its activities, or make use of the data
that someone else has exfiltrated from a network that is also of intelligence interest to
us (fourth party collection). This is sometimes called C-CNE (counter-CNE), not to be
confused with CCNE, which was the name of PTD for a few years.

2.2.3	Data mining for cyber discovery

CNE and CNA activity will leave traces in passive SIGINT. One of GCHQ’s key contentions in
discussions on spending for cyber has been that understanding the internet through SIGINT is
the best foundation on which to build any cyber capability, whether offensive or defensive. This
is the very first stage in the Cyber Wheel (figure 1), which is meant to be a visual representation
of all the aspects of cyber, with SIGINT at the centre. NSA produced a simpler and earlier
visualization [W43] of the same idea in 2007 (figure 2).

During the initial exploitation of a target box, malicious data needs to be delivered to the
target. We (as well as commercial anti-virus and security companies) try to produce signatures
for these infection vectors, which packets can be matched against.

Once machines have been implanted, they will usually perform certain characteristic activ-
ities on the network. Two major functions of an implant are beaconing, which involves sending
short periodic messages back to the implant’s controller confirming that the implant is alive
and available for tasking; and exfiltration, i.e. pulling back data from the target box.

The fact that these activities are visible in passive SIGINT presents an OpSec risk to
us [W7], but also an opportunity for data mining to discover hostile CNE activity. The core
of a particular actor’s infrastructure might be quite small, and discovering it can open up a
whole chunk of their activity to be defended against or countered.

Botnets are large collections of implanted machines under the control of a single bot-herder.
They are usually associated with organized criminals rather than intelligence agencies. Again

Figure 2: Another view of the relationship between CNO and Digital Network Intelligence (DNI),
i.e. passive network SIGINT.

there are stereotyped behaviour patterns associated with botnets: command and control ex-
changes (also called C&C or C2), which are analogous to beaconing for implants; and coordin-
ated activity in a short time window—for example many machines in the botnet simultaneously
trying to access a website being targeted in a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack.

Data mining offers the possibility of finding suspicious activity by detecting anomalies or
outliers in bulk data. Temporal analysis and behavioural pattern-matching can be used to
detect hostile network activity from CNE and botnets, but at present there is very little being
done in this direction on our streaming data feeds. Several of the problem areas in the rest of
this document touch on applications to these important cyber problems.

3	Beyond Supervised Learning

3.1	Introduction

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from training data. The
training data is a set of training examples. Each example is a pair consisting of a feature vector
and a desired output value (also called truthed data or labelled data). A training algorithm
analyses this data and produces an inferred function, which is called a classifier (if the output
is discrete) or a regression function (if the output is continuous). The inferred function should
predict the correct output value for any valid input object. This requires the learning algorithm
to generalise from the training data to unseen situations in a “reasonable” way.5

There are a vast number of supervised machine learning algorithms which can often produce
functions with high accuracies on real-world data sets. However, these techniques have had
surprisingly little impact in GCHQ. There are various reasons why this has been the case but
the principal reason has been the difficulty in creating training sets. In particular, the difficulty
comes from knowing the desired output value for many training examples, either due to the
required human effort and/or uncertainty in the desired output value. This difficulty is unlikely
to be a one-off issue for an operational application. The nature of communications and our data
changes with time and leads to “concept drift”; any algorithm must be periodically retrained.

The aim of this research area is to improve the adoption of machine learning techniques.
We suggest three ways forward on this area:

1.	Semi-supervised learning alters the setup of supervised learning by only knowing the
true value for a subset of training examples.

2.	A special case of semi-supervised learning is active learning: in this case the training
algorithm decides which examples it wants to be truthed. The aim is to make these the
most informative examples rather than waste human effort on randomly chosen cases.
This point-of-view also naturally works in a streaming context as a way of dealing with
concept drift.

3.	Allow ourselves to work with inaccurate truth data or weak labels. Such an approach
would allow more automated labelling or reduce the human effort required.

We provide some small example datasets that have come from supervised learning problems.
All examples in these datasets typically come with a label and a truth value. The scale of
these datasets should not limit your imagination and larger untruthed datasets should often
be obtainable either from the cloud or from a research area in GCHQ. If a very large number
of unlabelled examples is found to be of value then streaming or MapReduce techniques will
probably be needed.

It is important to note that the aim of this research is not necessarily to maximise the
accuracy of prediction on these datasets. In the main, these datasets are fully-truthed and thus
we expect that existing research on supervised learning will be competitive. Also these data
sets are fixed and are thus not tracking customer interests or concept drift.

We also include the problem of fusion of scores that may be approachable by a natural
extension of the weak labels research area.

3.1.1	Supervised learning prior work

Supervised learning has had many applications in the research community but few applications
have been deployed operationally. Some research examples over the last ten years (along
with the classifier type used) are: steganography detection (Random Forest) [I74], website
classification (decision tree) [I36], protocol classification (Random Forest and neural network)
[W1], spam detection (Random Forest) [I44], payphone detection (Random Forest) [I3] and
drug smuggler detection (logistic regression) [I77].

Random Forests

A common theme in many SIGINT applications is the use of Random Forest classifiers [E6]6.
Random Forests are an ensemble learning technique [W13]. The base learners are unpruned
decision trees [W10] which then vote to reach decision. Randomness is inserted into each tree
by two means. Firstly, each tree is built on a bootstrap sample of the training data. Secondly,
the trees are built in a top-down manner by choosing the best feature at each node from a
random subset of the features.

One reason for the use of Random Forests may be because they typically produce high
accuracies with little tuning. However our feature spaces may also naturally lend themselves
to Random Forests. Properties of our feature spaces include:

•	Features are typically based on categorical and count data. Random Forests can handle
a mixture of ordered and categorical feature types.

•	Our data do not often show simple clusters. Some features (e.g. port numbers in the
protocol classification example) behave a bit like ordered features and a bit like categorical
features (nearby ports are sometimes associated but not always).

•	Our features also show special values. A particular example could be a zero in a count
could derive from missing data due to limited SIGINT visibility rather than saying any-
thing relevant about the property of interest.

One adaptation to Random Forests considered in-house to improve accuracy and help un-
derstand the tuning of Random Forests is weighting of individual trees [I68].

Interpretability

A problem with the use of Random Forests is that their decisions can not be simply and intu-
itively explained to an analyst. This black box nature can lower analyst trust in a prediction.

(NSA R1) has been leading an effort to make Random Forests more interpretable
[I18]. It would be good if semi-supervised models could have a broad-brush interpretability
even if there are some complex exceptions that break these simple interpretations.

6The NSA were very early adopters of Random Forests through direct contact with	via the

NSA Statistical Advisory Group (NSASAG) [W31]. The NSASAG remain a useful conduit to statisticians at
US universities [W28].

Scale

The community has also considered scaling training of Random Forests to large datasets for
the rare cases where one has computer-based truthing.

The most trivial scaling is naive parallelisation per tree. To do this one duplicates the data
on multiple hosts, grows trees on each host independently and then combines the trees together
into a final forest. The author of [I74] found this approach helpful in building classifiers for
steganography detection.

NSA have looked at ways to implement Random Forests in Hadoop [I8, I4]. In GCHQ we
have looked at streaming approaches with Random Decision Trees [I61] and Very Fast Decision
Trees [I7].

3.1.2	Semi-supervised learning prior work

Semi-supervised learning is an area of active research in academia (see [E7] for a text-book
reference and [E46, E36] for literature reviews). Given our interest with Random Forests, the
recent paper on semi-supervised Random Forests may be of interest [E24].

However semi-supervised learning is less well developed in the intelligence community.
LLNL have been considering active learning approaches for finding cyber attacks [I13]. Fran-
cois Theberge at CRI has looked at transductive learning (a special case of semi-supervised
learning where a predictive function is not learnt at anywhere other than pre-chosen values)

[I80]. The GCHQ maths summer student programme (SSP) in 2011 have been asked to look
at transductive learning in the context of determining the relationship between entities [W32].

3.2	Semi-supervised learning

Semi-supervised learning algorithms “typically [use] a small amount of labeled data with a
large amount of unlabeled data.” [W38] This viewpoint is very desirable to GCHQ:

•	Like many organisations we have large datasets of which only a tiny subset can be truthed
by hand.

•	We have more metadata than content. For truthing we may require content but policy or
data volumes means that content is only available for a small fraction of the data covered
by metadata. Therefore classifiers that run on metadata but are truthed based on limited
(and not randomly selected) content are desirable.

Traditionally we have approached these problems with supervised learning and ignored all the
unlabelled data.

The overarching question of this research area is can we use semi-supervised learning to our
advantage? What shape must the problem have for there to be significant benefit?

3.2.1	How useful is semi-supervised learning?

There do not seem to be strong theoretical results in academia to explain the benefits of semi-
supervised learning as opposed to supervised learning. Can we develop an applicable theoretical ◄
understanding of semi-supervised learning?

Even if a theoretical understanding eludes us can we develop useful empirical rules of thumb ◄
on the value of semi-supervised learning? A simple starting point might be to measure gains
in accuracy based on different approaches for the example SIGINT datasets.

There are a range of known semi-supervised techniques; two major classes are: generative
models and low-density separation [E7]. Can we tell what type of algorithm one might want ◄
to use on a particular dataset?

What is the nature of a good feature space for semi-supervised learning? Are there feature ◄
transformations that could be applied to help this?

If our truthing comes from an automated process then we may have untruthed examples
that have failed automated classification. Alternatively if we truth a meta-data classifier based
on content then our truthing will only exist where we have content. In both these examples,
in contrast to the traditional viewpoint of semi-supervised learning, the truthed examples are
likely not to be independently distributed of the features or classes. In the missing value
imputation literature such truthing would be called “missing not at random” (MNAR). A
potential approach to handle such truthing is described in [E33]. Can we build valid models	◄

when the truthing is not independent of the feature space or classes?

In the above, we have assumed that each training example can be treated independently.
Many SIGINT datasets have relationships between examples which can be represented as a
graph. Progress is being made externally on graph-based semi-supervised learning (see [E17]	◄

and references therein) - can these external techniques be usefully applied to SIGINT problems?

3.2.2	Positive-only learning

A special case of semi-supervised learning is when we only have labels for some members of
one class and want to learn a binary classifier. An example is payphone classification where we
have lists of some payphones and no labels for other phone numbers.

In the outside literature^^^ [E13] presented a Bayesian approach to positive-only learning
but internally	[I50] pointed out an error in their approach. However, in the world of

statistical testing	has pointed out that one can still identify the most powerful test

by considering the quasi-power [I49]. This approach was successfully used in a positive-only
learning scenario for botnet detection [I71].

asks, can we find or develop a theorem of the form: “a binary classifier can	◄

be trained if and only if ...”. Can positive-only learning be shown to work with no other
constraints? This type of theorem would also be relevant to the rest of the beyond supervised
learning problem area.

Can we design a new classifier for positive-only learning?	◄

3.2.3	Active learning

Many approaches to semi-supervised learning present a random subset of the data for truthing.

This approach means that human effort is probably wasted classifying examples that have
little impact on the learnt function. Active learning instead sets up the truthing process as a
sequential process where the algorithm sequentially chooses examples for truthing based on all
the information so far at its disposal. A useful review of external research in active learning is
[E37].

The benefits of active learning are uncertain as an algorithm can focus on minor refinements
to the current model and deliberately ignore examples that if truthed would lead to major
changes to the current model. Do active learning algorithms quickly converge to a good model ◄
when allowed to choose which truthed items to use from the example datasets?

A risk with active learning is that after many truthing examples one decides that the chosen
algorithm is not suitable for the data set. It may not be practical to ask for more truthing with
a different algorithm. What happens if you take the partially truthed dataset from one active ◄
learning run and use that dataset with a different semi-supervised learning algorithm?

Active learning is a process where the algorithm and human are closely coupled and thus
human factors are important.	suggests looking at active learning

scenarios where the human is asked to rank two or three items rather then give a score or label.

This may be easier from a human factors point of view. Can we design algorithms for active ◄
learning based on ranking pairs? How does the number of example pairs required compare
to the number of truthed examples in traditional active learning? See [E35] for an example
supervised approach.

3.2.4	New algorithms and implementations

The asymptotic complexity of many semi-supervised learning algorithms is not good
(e.g. O(n3), where n is the number of examples, or worse) [E46]. Such complexities are likely
to be prohibitive on large datasets. Ideally we would like algorithms to run in O(n log n) or
better.

We’d be interested in new accurate and fast semi-supervised learning techniques. The ◄
requirement to scale to large datasets will hopefully lead to streaming and/or MapReduce
implementations.

The SIGINT datasets provided may also inspire new techniques to enhance classification
accuracies.

(NSA R6) suggests that we may often be in the scenario that we have our
truthed data as a small data set on which one can do a large amount of in-memory computation
but our untruthed data as a large dataset in Hadoop. Can a learning algorithm be developed	◄

that iterates between complex in-memory analysis of the truthed data and single table scans
of the untruthed data?

3.3	Unreliable marking of data

An alternative approach to improve the applicability of machine learning techniques is to allow
inaccurate truthing of data, so called “weak labels”. We think of this case as related to semi-
supervised learning; in traditional semi-supervised learning you have perfect knowledge of some
cases and no knowledge of other cases - in the case of weak labels this knowledge is diffused
across the entire dataset.

3.3.1	Weak labels

Scenarios where weak labels could occur are:

Semi-synthetic data: If suitable training data can not be found we may want to modify
data to have the properties we want. An example of this is steganography detection [I74].

We take a large number of images from SIGINT and add steganography into some the
images to make our truthed data. Errors will occur as some of these images may have
steganography before we start.

Automated labelling: We might base our labels on content based-signatures that may not
be accurate (e.g. for protocol classification [I70]).

Natural error: Even experts make mistakes when labelling.

Externally the field of weak labels has been rejuvenated by the use of the internet for
truthing by amateurs, e.g. using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk where one may have multiple
labels per item [E31]. However, the field dates back many years; for example [E27] showed the
impact of weak labels on nearest-neighbour classifiers and ^-consistent estimators.

Another recent approach has been MIForests [E23] which shows an approach to adapt
Random Forests to binary classifiers based on sets of inaccurately marked data.

As mentioned in section 3.2.2 by looking at quasi-power [I49] we can work directly with
weakly labelled items (with some constraints on the labelling) to identify a most powerful test.

Can we understand the influence of labelling errors on different techniques? Do some ◄
traditional supervised learning techniques work out-of-the-box with weak labels?

Can we develop algorithms that understand and compensate for the errors?	◄

3.3.2	Fusion of scores

A problem which might be a natural extension of this work is fusion of scores. For example,
we have multiple techniques to try to infer a relationship between entities (e.g. from contacts,
timing behaviour and geo behaviour). These techniques produce scores that are typically real
numbers between 0 (no relationship) and 1 (a relationship exists). If these were (proportional
to) independent likelihoods then these scores could simply be multiplied. However, these scores
will not be independent and will not be likelihoods. How can we combine such scores in general? ◄
Can we combine such scores to posterior probabilities? How large a deviation from independent
likelihoods can we cope with?

This problem is exactly the problem of weak labels if we treat one score as being a weak
label and the rest of the scores as features. We have the added power that we can choose any
feature as the weak label.

Internally we have considered score fusion in two main contexts:

Relationship scoring: CHART BREAKER [I31] research initially looked at handling the
multiple scores derived from the email communication hypergraph but is currently being

with a decision for an IP address’s country.

If we’re dealing with labels rather than scores then there’s a line of literature in medical
statistics looking at estimating the accuracy of diagnostic tests. These are based on the Hui-
Walter method of independent tests [E19, E32, E21]. Extensions have now looked at correlated
tests [E11]. [E38] makes the link between these approaches and latent class models and thus
this problem can be seen to be related to that being considered	at LLNL for

learning with network data [I58]. [E31] shows an extension to real valued functions.

NSA have also looked at this problem in the context of log-likelihoods that may not be
independent [I45] (their approach has been reviewed by GCHQ [I26]).

3.4	Relevant data

3.4.1	Truthed datasets

We provide various SIGINT truthed datasets as summarised in table 1. Most of these data
sets consist of features and truthed output for all examples. There are a few exceptions:

•	The protocol classification set has some “NULL” labels for which automated signature-
based classification failed. This dataset can be seen as an example of a semi-supervised
set where the truthed examples are not randomly chosen.

•	The payphone data set comes with no features. We do not have feature extraction in
Hadoop. Implementation of the features in [I3] should not be too large a task and
implementing a complete system would aid deployment.

•	The arrival process correlation data set has no features extracted. Also the truthing
comes as two sets where one set is richer in true cases than the other. This data is
included as it is an active area of statistical research and overlaps with the information
flow in graphs problem. If features are required for this set then the CLASP scores [I49]
could be useful features but new approaches would also be welcome.

For the fully-truthed data sets in table 1 it is imagined that semi-supervised or weak label
experiments can be conducted by hiding truth labels or perturbing truth labels.

The steganography detection dataset may also be a good dataset if we want to look at
cost-sensitive feature extraction within the context of semi-supervised learning. The features
are computed in classes, each with a cost. We can give some metrics on these costs if required.

It should be remembered that the aim of this problem area is not to maximise the accuracy
of classification on these datasets. These datasets should be used to support improvements in
understanding and algorithms.

A flaw with these datasets is that they are mostly small (having derived from experiments
with supervised learning). The ability of algorithms to scale to larger sizes should be considered.
The payphone data may be the most promising one to look at at scale.

3.4.2	Fusion of scores data

We provide fusion of scores data from GeoFusion. Scores in GeoFusion are typically ordered
confidence labels (“low” to “very high”) rather than real numbers. We provide the country and
confidence from four SIGINT systems as well as the Akamai Edgescape commercial geolocation
dataset. See appendix F.5 for more details on this data.

We hope that data for fusion of identifier relationship scores will be available soon. Al-
ternatively researchers could use existing software to compute scores from telephony or C2C
data on the cloud themselves - please consult the authors for more guidance on this route if
required.

3.5	Collaboration points

There are several areas where one might find useful collaboration in this problem area:

ICTR-MCA: The Media Content Analysis team are looking to automatically determine
the relationship between entities based on communication content and think that semi-
supervised techniques are likely to be needed;	is leading on this work.

and	also think that their work on speaker identification

may lead to a semi-supervised problems with weak labels.	is also plan-

ning to revisit the problem of finding IED triggers in audio content and which may lead
to a dataset with features derived from roughly continuous data (as opposed to many of
the provided sets being based on discrete data), see [W44] for more details.

4	Information Flow in Graphs

4.1	Introduction

This section of the problem book concerns information flow in graphs. By this we mean the
study and discovery of related information or messages being relayed over multiple edges in a
communications graph. For this problem we will initially consider working on a static graph,
although you should feel free to consider the streaming case if you desire. We get to observe a
set of transactions taking place on the edges of the graph. Given these transactions we would
like to be able to infer something about likely information flows across multiple edges. In most
cases we will know nothing of the content of the transactions. We therefore wish to focus mainly
on techniques which do not require any content knowledge. Data with content should therefore
mainly be seen as truthed data for exploration and familiarisation with existing techniques.

We will now provide two motivating examples for our interest in information flow in graphs.
These are chosen to reflect intelligence interests over the last decade or so.

The first example is a target-centric communications network. Consider the graph formed
by telephone calls around a certain target set. Each call, or transaction, serves the purpose of
conveying information between participants. If significant flows could be extracted then this
would provide information on the structure of the target set—perhaps identifying commanders,
middlemen and operatives. Now, if one of the commanders was no longer part of the network
we could again examine how the flows have changed and therefore gain insight on any reorgan-
isation that has taken place. Further, it may even be possible to identify a significant change
in flows on the graph and identify a change in structure purely from transactional data.

The second example is the detection of botnet command and control infrastructure. For a
botnet to be effective it needs to be able to convey commands from its controller to all infected
nodes. One can imagine that with some knowledge of infected nodes it may be possible to use
information flows to trace out the infrastructure, discover further infections, or even track back
to find the botnet’s owner. This type of capability would be of enormous interest due to the
current emphasis on cyber defence.

We now define a cascade and discuss how we will use them to summarise the significant
information flows.

Figure 3: Examples of cascades. A downwards pointing triangle is a source and an upwards one
a sink. A diamond means the node is both the source and a sink.

Definition 1. A cascade is defined to be a directed connected subgraph with a single source
and one or more sinks, consisting only of directed paths from the source to every sink. Being
a source or sink is considered an attribute rather than necessarily having no in or out edges
respectively.

Figure 3 shows some example cascades. Subfigure 3(b) demonstrates a cascade where the
source is also a sink—there is nothing in the definition which prohibits this. Further, we can
imagine situations with an information flow like this. For instance consider a friend to ask their
friend for a favour and then having the response relayed back.

Cascades can be used to represent significant, repeated information flows on the graph. Each
directed edge in the cascade, starting from the source, should occur no earlier in time than its
predecessors. Algorithms developed should probably output such representative cascades.

We are interested in techniques which do not depend upon having the content of transactions
as this limits their applicability. This is because much metadata is of the form “A communicated
with B at time t”, with few or no clues to what the content of that communication was. Because
our data is in this form we place a particular emphasis on temporal correlation when surveying
past work.

This section of the problem book has a relatively small number of wide problems. This
is because the main problem of information flow definition and discovery is meant to be open
ended with plenty of scope for exploration and experimentation7.

4.2	Past work

We will now describe past work in related areas of research, with a particular emphasis on
internal research. We will introduce key areas of work, give a sketch of their workings and
provide references for further reading. External work discussed should be seen as a sample
rather than a definitive list.

This subsection will first discuss methods on graphs, starting with explicitly temporal ones
and then moving on to static ones. We will then discuss the extensive research that has
been conducted on temporal correlation of stochastic processes. We expect that research on
information flow in graphs may want to draw on all areas, perhaps applying our knowledge on
temporal correlation in a graphical setting.

4.2.1	Graphical methods

There have been several approaches used to exploit timing information present in transactions
on graphs. If two vertices participate in timing patterns then it is likely that they are closely
related. Further if one of these vertices is a target then the other may be worth investigating
more closely.

The first temporal graph algorithm in GCHQ was Remit, developed under contract by
Detica for ICTR-DMR [I78]. A large amount of subsequent research can be seen to have been
directly triggered by the Chains analytic within Remit. Chains is about the simplest approach
possible to finding information flow in graphs. One simply defines a maximum time allowed

7The problem “Find and score related stochastic processes” has already had many man-years of research
effort expended across dozens of approaches.

between transactions on adjacent edges and a minimum flow length. The Chains algorithm
will then find all flows satisfying these conditions. Despite this simplicity trials showed that
it could produce useful intelligence when applied to a target-centric telephony graph [I41].
Unsurprisingly, given its fixed time window, Chains had issues with flows spuriously going
through vertices with a high activity rate. This motivated the next stage of research in temporal
graph methods.

PRIME TIME [I42] was the next approach created. PRIME TIME introduced a statistical
model to compensate for varying vertex activity levels. Specifically an exponential distribution
is fitted to a vertex based upon its mean time between transactions. This exponential is used to
calculate a p-value on waiting times for transactions on pairs of adjacent edges. If the p-value is
less than some critical value then the transactions will be considered related. Furthermore the
p-values are collected for future scoring of long and/or repeated flows. However the methods
of combination used are ad-hoc and not statistically motivated. The original PRIME TIME
paper talks of chains of related edges, although in practice only length 2 were computed. Even
so this suggests the beginning of the study of information flow in graphs.

Currently a streaming version of PRIME TIME is being developed by Detica for the Stream-
ing Analysis team in ICTR [I63].

HIDDEN OTTER is an ICTR-NE prototype that similarly tries to find temporal chains
in communications data [I62]. In particular they are interested in finding things such as back-
haul networks, TOR networks and botnet structures. It has the simple approach of finding
temporally ordered chains of transactions on edges starting from a specified set of seed nodes.
HIDDEN OTTER is essentially a reinvention of the Remit Chains algorithm, but in Hadoop.

BAKER’S DOZEN is a technique for finding batches of near-sequential phone numbers
that display causal behaviour [I11]. Given population-level telephony data it generates a list of
pairs of telephone numbers that are near-sequential. For each of these pairs it conducts tests to
discover if they are causally related. One of these tests is temporally correlated communications
with the same third party. This third party condition is important at population level as
otherwise there are too many random coincidences due to identifiers merely being active at the
same time. CLASP8 was rejected for having little statistical power due to exactly this reason.
The BAKER’S DOZEN test measures the proportion of events which involve a common third
party and occur within t minutes of each other. A beta distributed prior and most powerful
value for t were learnt from the data. The causal threshold was learnt by evaluating the statistic
for 20 million random pairs and then choosing the value which led to a p-value of 10-6. This
statistic proved to be powerful in the sense of promoting many pairs above the causal threshold.

There has been a large amount of research on information diffusion and cascades in the
external literature e.g. [E44, E18, E25, E29]. However the focus has tended to be on datasets
where one can directly observe the pieces of information flowing through the network. Examples
could be hashtags through Twitter or the spread of disease through a contact network. R66
at NSA have developed a MapReduce algorithm based on [E18] to track the passing of files
between implanted machines [I35]. The reading rack for this problem (on [W24]) contains a
number of citations of external papers considering information cascades and diffusion. Those
papers should provide a good starting point in the literature, but is nowhere near exhaustive.

Internally there has been some research on block modelling [I28, I29, I30]. Block modelling

Figure 4: An example of the non-homogeneous Poisson process used in [149, 164, 152]. Here we
are testing the hypothesis that R’s events are triggered by As. We therefore “project” £Ts events
onto A's timeline: the first falls 0.2 of the way between two A events, the second 0.3 and the third
0.4. This figure is adapted from [164]

assumes that vertices in a graph each belong to different classes. The communication between
vertices is then determined entirely by their classes. The job of a block modelling algorithm
is therefore to assign vertices to classes and describe how the classes interact with each other.
Although this has not so far considered information flows there is the possibility that they could
be useful for block modelling. Further the outputs of certain block models may be interpretable
in a similar manner to potential applications of information flows. For instance both may be
able to distinguish directors, middle managers and workers in a company hierarchy. Is it
possible to use block modelling to inform the discovery of information flows?

4.2.2	Temporal correlation

Internally there has been much research undertaken in understanding temporal correlation
between stochastic processes. This work should be a great aid in tackling the information flow
in graphs problem area, especially when the information cannot be directly observed flowing
over the graph. If we are interested in comparing adjacent edges then this work is directly
applicable by restricting the scored processes to those with a common vertex.

This research started in 2005, motivated by a desire to find cross-media temporal correla-
tions. An example of a cross-media correlation would be A calling B to arrange for B to initiate
an instant messenger conversation with him. [149] found that modelling the stochastic processes
as non-homogeneous Poisson processes (NHPP) gave the best performance of the approaches
attempted. This contrasts to PRIME TIME which models activity as a homogeneous Pois-
son process. Assuming that one can model the rate function of the NHPP correctly then the
events of unrelated processes should fall uniformly with respect to each other. Figure 4 shows
an example of this mapping. All tests seek to find deviations from this null hypothesis. The
original paper proposed 14 tests for non-uniformity, some of which place particular emphasis
on the start of the interval.

Ongoing research on this strand of temporal correlation can be seen to fall into two areas:

testing for non-uniformity and improving rate function estimation. The current best test for
non-uniformity is the PCG statistic [I64]. This uses the fact that if there are k points uniformly
distributed on (0,1) then the first of these is distributed according to a Beta(1,k) distribution.
One can then calculate a left-tail p-value for each interval and combine them using Fisher’s
method. This simple method beats more complicated approaches [I6, I39, I23, I65] on the
standard datasets. The current best technique for rate function estimation is described in
[I52]. This is a two stage process. Firstly one clusters the set of stochastic processes. Secondly
one counts time not in seconds but in the number of events that have occurred within a process’
cluster. It is worth contemplating why this works. Consider the phones belonging to GCHQ
employees - these cannot be brought into the building and so are very quiet between 9 and 5. If
an employee turns their phone on at the end of the day and responds to a voicemail left earlier
in the day then this activity has been triggered despite the multi-hour gap. By performing this
transformation we turn this from a gap of many hours to one of a few events and we are better
able to spot the causality.

The slide deck [I47] contain details of much of the research conducted before October 2010.
This does not however include the cluster-based rate estimation from [I52].

Research into a streaming implementation of the PCG algorithm has been conducted in R1
at NSA [I51]. The work focuses mainly on data structures and approximations to allow the
algorithm to remain within main memory. However given the large size of some of the datasets
for this problem the techniques outlined may be useful should scaling prove to be a problem.

R1 have started to investigate using inference on a parametric model for how causal time
series are generated [I24]. This proposes a mixture model where B’s events happen either
according to an underlying Poisson process or because of a causal A event. They demonstrate
that this is a continous Markov process and formulate tests on whether given pairs of stochastic
processes are likely to be correlated. When the model assumptions are correct their likelihood
ratio statistic is tens of times more powerful than the best general methods known at small
sizes for some generating parameters.

Many of these techniques are included in the CLASP software package, with new methods
added once demonstrated as useful.	maintains CLASP. It is available on the LID

at /data/cryptomath_research/windata/infoproc/Software/CLASP/

SAGA is a technique which extends a measure of item similarity to set similarity [I48]. It
has provably desirable properties and has case studies that have demonstrated its utility. In
particular it has been used as a method for performing temporal correlations. If one treats a
stochastic process as a set of times and defines a similarity measure between times then SAGA
may be applied to measure the similarity of pairs of stochastic processes. This approach is
radically different to anything else attempted and can perform surprisingly well on the standard
CLASP datasets.

4.3.1	Definition and Discovery

The first and most fundamental problem is the definition and discovery of information flows ◄
in the graphs. This document deliberately declines to provide a mathematical definition of an
information flow. There is not an immediately obvious definition and therefore it seems best
to leave this as part of the problem. It was suggested by	of R1 that it may

be a good idea to start from how you would define it given perfect information and then work
backwards. However hopefully the examples given in the introduction sufficiently illustrate the
type of things we hope to find. Further thinking about cascades as previously defined may help
with a definition.

of R1 suggested an approach for defining repeated information flows. One could
phrase it as learning a distribution over when/which edge will have a transaction next given
previous (and possibly future) activity on adjacent edges and further information, such as time
of day. Repeated information flows could then be seen as high likelihood paths through this dis-
tribution. Can such a probability distribution be written down in a form where (approximately) ◄
evaluating it is tractable?

The Enron and SKB datasets are atypical of SIGINT data in that there is information
on the content available. However this should be very useful for formulating definitions of
information flow as it will be easier to see the flows occurring. In the SKB the flows correspond
to various media being passed around the internet. The circulation of extremist media is of
particular intelligence interest. It is suggested that these datasets be seen as truthed data and
for gaining familiarity with techniques suggested in the literature. We are less interested in
developing new techniques which depend upon having the content of transactions as this limits
their applicability. We are therefore probably restricted to extracting flows which repeat rather
than occur singly. What do the SKB and Enron datasets tell us about how well we can extract	◄

information flows without content? Can we perform exploratory data analysis on the SKB to	◄

inform the definition and discovery of flows? Can we spot typical transfer patterns?	◄

Research on improving CLASP has been aided by the availability of two standard datasets.
These each consist of two subsets—a random sample of processes for which there is no reason
to believe any relationship exists, and a sample of pairs for which there is some external reason
to believe a relationship may exists. This allows ROC curves [W34] to be compared between
techniques and an objective comparison to take place. Can similar datasets and comparison ◄
mechanisms can be created for this problem and therefore help drive research collaboration?

There have been many different approaches to temporal correlation, both explicitly graph-
based and not, as demonstrated in the previous subsection. Can we find a theory that unifies ◄
these approaches? One possible direction is to consider having placed a prior distribution on
the probability of a significant temporal correlation being present. For example CLASP can
be seen as putting a uniform prior over all pairs of edges, while PRIME TIME is uniform only
over edges sharing a common vertex.

4.3.2	Missing data and noise

SIGINT data is almost always incomplete. In terms of this problem certain edges may not
have been observed or some transactions on edges may be missing. In experiments carried out
on billing records and SIGINT during the 2008 graph mining SWAMP at HIMR there was

shown be a huge disparity between our view of the world and ground truth [I73]. CSEC have
perform similar analyses with similar conclusions [W4]. It is therefore important to be resilient
to missing data, especially where a flow may be cut in two. An internal example of coping with
missing edges is SALTY OTTER [W37]. It uses CLASP to find likely cross-media triggering
patterns, for example telephone conversations typically causing instant messenger chats. The
tool is essentially coping with the missing edge and allowing the information flow to carry on
regardless.

There has been some external work on how sampling or missingness affects the appearance
of information diffusion and cascades. [E9] evaluates how different sampling strategies affect
the view of hashtag diffusion in Twitter. Clearly we do not generally get to choose how our
data is sampled, but this work may help the understanding of how well/poorly we are likely
to do. [E34] goes further in proposing a method to correct for missing data in information
cascades. Their method assumes that cascades are k-trees, each vertex in the graph is sampled
with uniform probability and the graph structure is known for sampled vertices. Given these,
they claim to be successful in reconstructing properties of the original cascades. These external ◄
approaches assume that we have the content of a transaction—is there anything we can do
when we do not?

The obvious approach to this problem is to remove edges/transactions from a dataset to
simulate poor collection. We can then evaluate different coping strategies by seeing how our
performance is impacted. Here the Enron dataset is probably a good place to start, as we
have ground truth and can uniquely guarantee that it is the complete dataset. However any
technique developed must behave sensibly on SIGINT data.

The data that we do have has further problems beyond missingness. In particular the
quality of the timing information is not as good as we might hope for. This presents at least
two concrete problems. Firstly, our data tends to have second timestamps, which may be
too coarse a measure for many applications. Does the granularity of the timestamps affect	◄

our chances of finding causal flows? Secondly the clocks on our probes are not synchronised.

This means that there is likely to be a constant offset between events happening on different
bearers. Any technique to correct for this offset will both aid this problem area and be of
general interest to the internal data mining and information processing community. Can we ◄
correct for the clock offset between probes? Possible solutions may involve examining the same
connection being intercepted on different bearers.

4.4	Potential future interests

There are further problems in this area that may become tractable as the subject knowledge
grows.

4.4.1	Performing inference on flows

Assuming that information flows can successfully be identified and extracted we should then be
able to perform inference on/with them. The obvious first area to investigate would be anomaly
and change detection. The interest in this was hinted at in the introduction in investigating
how a target network changes after the removal of a commander. Given that this document
does not even define a flow then it is not reasonable to scope this future problem any more

tightly. Should you reach a point where you can tackle this problem you should have a good
idea of what anomalies and changes mean within the framework you have developed.

4.4.2	Information flow for graph generation

There are many existing models for graph generation. Examples include the Forest Fire al-
gorithm [E26] and Bollobas-Janson-Riordan family of graphs [E5]. However, these approaches,
although sequential, do not describe how graphs are truly generated. That is, they do not
accurately correspond to how a graph, and the transactions on it, are generated in reality. If
the definition and discovery of information flows is successful then it may be possible to use the
descriptive models for graph generation. This feels far closer to how graphs are really gener-
ated. Each transaction is undertaken to convey information. Therefore adequately modelling
the flows leads to the observations.	of	may well be

interested in such ideas as he has stated dissatisfaction with the existing approaches. There is
probably limited SIGINT interest in this problem unless a convincing argument can be made
otherwise. We know of no internal work on any subject which has used any graph generation
algorithm.

4.5	Relevant data

We have several relevant datasets with truthed data, of which some have already been men-
tioned in the main body of this section.

The Enron (appendix F.2.1) and SKB (appendix F.1.4) datasets are atypical as most
SIGINT data does not have any content associated with it. They can be treated as truthed
datasets for the evaluation of algorithms for extracting significant information flows.

We also have a large dump of FIVE ALIVE (appendix F.1.2) that summarises all IP con-
nections on research bearers. There is no content associated with this data. We do have some
truthing on flows that may exist in the data. Specifically, we have data on covert infrastructure
(appendix F.3.3) used for exfiltrating data from CNE implants. These suspected flows can be
used for both EDA and evaluation purposes. Further, we have lists of IPs that we suspect to
be infected with the Conficker botnet (appendix F.3.4), either due to signatures collected or
behavioural analysis. Again, we suspect that there are some information flows involving these
IP addresses.

We also provide two standard datasets used for evaluating temporal correlation algorithms
(appendix F.1.5). If you have any insights on how to perform temporal correlation due to your
work on this problem you may wish to use these for evaluation purposes.

4.6	Collaboration points

There are several collaboration opportunities available for information flow in graphs.

to hear of new ideas and approaches. He also indicated an interest in this new research
area.

5	EDA on Streams

5.1	Introduction

5.1.1	EDA

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is all about trying to find interesting features of data
without necessarily having pre-formed hypotheses to test. One of the pioneers of EDA was
J. Tukey [E41, E42], who argued for the value of EDA over the traditional statistical approach,
which he called confirmatory data analysis, where one starts with an hypothesis and collects
data in order to test it. In EDA, the data comes first, and what counts is understanding the
data as it is.

For the data analyst, this is an open-ended problem that is not tightly defined, but for the
mathematical researcher developing algorithms, things are much more concrete. The aim is to
use one’s intuition, guided by domain-specific knowledge from the analysts, to develop precise
algorithms that provide human insight on the data.

We usually think of EDA as being concerned with

•	pulling out global properties of data;

•	broad-brush visualizations of data.

The second is really a variant of the first: we can reduce the data to more discrete values
than a human could take in in a list or table, as long as there is a way to visualize them.
(Compare summarizing pairs by a correlation coefficient, or in a scatter-plot.)

5.1.2	Streams

In a stream we do not have enough memory to store everything we see, and we only get to
see each piece of data once. Many problems admit simple approximate solutions in the static
setting by subsampling. In the stream, this option is not always available. The problems
become much harder and controlling error estimates in approximate solutions is very difficult.
On the other hand, streaming analysis gives us the opportunity to get situational awareness
and real-time tipping from our data, as well as letting us process bigger datasets than we can
afford to store. These are key benefits that we strongly want to capitalize on.

For hands-on work, we are thinking of DISTILLERY, as opposed to Hadoop (see appen-
dices B and C).

One way to think about the problem is in terms of data structures. There are only a
few structures that we typically use to keep track of data when we write programs: lists, trees,
heaps, hash tables and so on. What carries through to the streaming setting? Which structures
can we update in a stream? If we can tolerate some loss, can we maintain approximations to
familiar data structures in the stream? If so, can we quantify and bound the errors? These
streaming data structures are then the building blocks for streaming algorithms. Given a
particular data stream, what is an appropriate data structure that will capture what we need
to know about the data in order to answer the SIGINT questions we have?

A short survey summarizing various approaches to streaming data can be found in [E39].
The 2009 Information Processing SCAMP at La Jolla also produced relevant material [I12].

Note on terminology

When we speak of streaming graph algorithms at GCHQ, we are usually referring to what the
external literature calls the semi-streaming paradigm. If the graph has n vertices, then we can
typically store a small amount of information for each vertex, but we are not able to store all
the edges or do any significant processing as each edge arrives. In other words, we assume we
have O(n log n) storage, and can do O(1) work per event. (Usually this can be O(1) amortized
work, as long as this does not cause undue back pressure: see section B.5.1.)

5.1.3	The problems

The problem areas on this topic overlap at the edges, and also tend to merge into the streaming
expiring graphs problems, but to give some order to this section we loosely cluster them into
four areas:

•	graph problems with no sub-sampling allowed;

•	visualization;

•	modelling and outlier detection;

•	profiling and correlation.

5.2	Graph problems with no sub-sampling

5.2.1	The framework of graphs and hypergraphs

Events data frequently has a natural representation as a graph, or more generally a hypergraph.
Often, an event will be a communication between two entities, which we think of as an edge
between two vertices, one vertex for each entity. There will normally be a notion of the
originator and recipient of the communication, which makes the graph into a directed graph.
Sometimes, a communication can involve more than two nodes, in which case we can think of
it as a hyperedge, and the overall structure a hypergraph9. We also look at graphs other than
communications graphs: for example, colocation graphs, where vertices are joined by an edge
if they were geolocated to the same place at the same time; network graphs, whose edges are
physical links; or even semantic graphs, where nodes are concepts and edges relations between
them.

Frequently, our data will come with additional information beyond the simple fact that
a communication took place. For example, each vertex will have a boolean attribute, ‘Is
this entity a target in BROAD OAK?’ Similarly, edges might have attributes like ‘duration
of communication’. A common metaphor is to think of discrete attributes as colours and
continuous attributes as weights. Although we often need to do algorithmic computations on
the underlying graph or digraph, taking account of the available attributes can enrich the
SIGINT value of any analysis we do.

9Some people prefer to think of simple hypergraphs as bipartite graphs, where the vertices and hyperedges
are the two parts, and edges represent inclusion.

We are interested in finding global properties of graphs in a stream—exactly if possible, but
we expect that approximate solutions will often be the best we can hope for. This is obviously
closely related to the streaming expiring graphs topic, but in our case we are not worried about
expiring edges, and we focus more on counting rather than identifying and extracting graph
structures. Probabilistic counting in general (not specifically in a graph context) has been an
area of active research both internally [I72, I40, I5] and externally [E16, E8] in recent years.

5.2.2	Cliques and other motifs

An n-clique is a subgraph isomorphic to a complete graph Kn. In a communication graph, this
corresponds to an intuitive idea of a strong, close community, where everyone communicates
with everyone else.

For EDA purposes, we would like to understand the clique structure of a streaming graph.
What are the cliques? If a target node belongs to a k-clique, how surprising is that?

One way to answer the second question is to get a good random graph model for the
communication graph, and do Monte Carlo simulations to find out how likely k-cliques are to
occur in the model graphs. There has been a lot of work on this, for example [I1, I57], but it has
proved very difficult to find models that capture all the relevant properties of SIGINT graphs,
or even to understand exactly what ‘relevant properties’ we want to capture. An alternative
approach is to just work empirically with the graph we see, and try to estimate how many
k-cliques it has: this gives us some measure of how surprised we should be if target nodes
belong to such a clique.

This leads us to consider probabilistic counting. We might want to count not just cliques,
but other subgraphs too: perhaps a clique with one edge missing. A motif in a graph is a
subgraph isomorphic to a particular pattern graph: for example, when the pattern graph is a
Kn, the motifs matching it are the n-cliques. There are probabilistic algorithms for counting
the cardinality of a set: for example, Flajolet et al.’s hyperloglog sketches [E16], proposed
on the outside and extended internally by	[I72]. There are also a variety of

algorithms for counting triangles, i.e. 3-cliques. One example is [E40];	[E8]

has produced a good survey.

Is there a probabilistic counting algorithm for cliques or other motifs in a streaming graph? ◄
What can we say about error bounds?

Besides counting, we might also be interested in motif collection. If we have two fixed
target nodes then motifs containing both nodes will give information about their common
neighbours. For example, how many distinct V-shapes or squares contain them both? Some
CSEC work [I21] from a few years ago may be relevant.

Can we collect specified motifs containing a target node or nodes?	◄

Removing pizza nodes (i.e. very high-degree nodes) is likely to be an essential prior com-
ponent to get useful results. Intuitively, a pizza node is likely to be a large impersonal entity
like a pizza parlour or an electricity supplier: the fact that two people both communicate with
the pizza node gives us no reason to think that they are linked socially.

5.2.3	Trusses

Let k > 3. A k-truss is a connected graph with > 2 vertices such that every edge of the graph is
reinforced by at least k — 2 pairs of edges that make a triangle with that edge. This concept was
developed	at NSA: the idea is to weaken the definition of a clique (any k-clique

is certainly a k-truss) to allow for a few missing edges, but still capture the notion of a cohesive
community, and at the same time produce something that is computationally tractable.

People in the SIGINT community have looked quite a bit at trusses, following on from the
foundational theoretical work	[I15, I14] on properties of trusses, their relationship

to cores and cliques, and streaming algorithms to find them. In particular, there has been
some experimental work [I76] looking at trusses in communication graphs. The findings were
surprising: there turned out to be huge k-trusses for quite large values of k, like k = 17. This
was true even after splitting trusses at cut-points. A number of variants and generalizations
have also been proposed (for example [I16, I17]).

We would like to understand why these form. Is there a better definition of truss that ◄
captures something like a closed-loop intuition (see section 2.1.3) without pulling in huge mon-
strosities?

In particular, as we have mentioned, a truss can have cut-points, i.e. single vertices whose ◄
removal disconnects the graph. On the other hand, trusses have high edge connectivity: one
has to remove at least k — 1 edges from a k-truss to make it disconnected. Can we define truss-
like structures with a different balance of vertex and edge connectivity? Do giant structures
still form?

Can we use a partial order derived from truss or core structures to perform hierarchical ◄
clustering? If so, can we avoid forming giant clusters?

Can we understand when community detection or clustering algorithms produce giant ◄
clusters? Are there ways to prove (given some probabilistic model for the graph) that with
high probability an algorithm will not produce large clusters? One specific suggestion by ^
is to look at clique percolation [E4] where there are multiple labels per node.

What is the background distribution of sizes of k-trusses? Is there a probabilistic solution ◄
(cf. the previous section)?

5.2.4	Other approaches

There are also more open-ended questions about streaming algorithms for graphs.

What graph invariants are both useful and can be found or approximated in a stream? ◄

In the academic world, there is a whole cottage industry devoted to coming up with new
clustering algorithms. Many will not have much use beyond allowing someone to publish a
paper. Is there a hidden gem in the open literature that the SIGINT community has missed? ◄

This problem obviously has the potential to lead one off down rabbit holes. As a concrete
thing to look at, the first author has identified BIRCH [W3] as an algorithm that may deserve
a hearing.

Can we compute any measurements of centrality or betweenness in a stream? (We are ◄
more interested in centrality measures in subgraphs around targets: CHART BREAKER [W6]
vertex scores do something like this.) How stable are they as the graph evolves? Is there
concept drift?

Can we approximate the graph distance distribution, and see how it varies with the pizza ◄
threshold?

This has a bearing on what hop distance we should choose for contact chaining. Conven-
tionally, analysts focus on a 2-hop neighbourhood of their targets, but some work comparing
billing records with SIGINT [I73] found that one needed to chain much, much further through
SIGINT to reach a 2-hop neighbourhood from billing data. Can we use the SIGINT to billing ◄
mapping (SOLID INK to FLUID INK—see appendix F.1.6) to help decide what the right thing
to measure on a telephony graph is?

CSEC have also done some work [W4] on comparing SIGINT and billing records. Billing
data is unlikely to be shareable, but for comparing results on different datasets, H4A would be
a natural point of collaboration.

5.3 Visualization

5.3.1	Visualization in general

For most people, visualization is a crucial ingredient in the sense-making loop when given a
large amount of data to analyse. GCHQ is actively developing tools for visual analytics. A
large team in ICTR, split between MCA and DMR, works on semantic graphs and visualization
research [W14], and a visual analytics tool called MAMBA [W27] is currently being developed
in partnership with Detica. For graph visualization, NSA’s Renoir application [W33] is also
under active development.

As HIMR researchers explore data for themselves, they will naturally develop their own
visualizations to help them understand it. We encourage them to record what they come up
with: perhaps some of these ad hoc visualizations could be useful to analysts too.

HIMR’s expertise is obviously in algorithms, not developing sophisticated visual analytics
platforms. Nonetheless, what dynamic or interactive visual tools would be helpful to explore ◄
SIGINT data sets, if someone else could be enlisted to create them?

GRINNING ROACH [W17] and PIRATE CAREBEAR [W30] are existing tools for visual-
izing SIGINT events, developed by DMR: they both produce plots for pattern-of-life analysis.

Dashboarding is well-established for electronic attack events, both internally and by anti-
virus and security companies. Can similar methods be applied to provide useful visualizations ◄
for traditional SIGINT analysis?

There is some work in progress at GCHQ [W5] on dashboarding for the 2012 Olympics, but
it is fair to say that the approaches so far are not mathematically sophisticated.

5.3.2	Streaming plots

There has been some work in R1 on binning streaming data for histograms [I37].

What interesting plots can be produced in a stream?	◄

suggests starting with QQ-plots; this is closely related to the problem of
computing approximate quantiles of streaming data.

CISA have also done some work [I55] on time series modelling in a stream, including bund-
ling up R for use in DISTILLERY: this may be a good foundation to build on.

produced, could they be refined to produce plots (from which those statistics could be read
off)?

5.4	Modelling and outlier detection

5.4.1	Identifying outlier activity

Outliers (e.g. low-volume telephone numbers, small connected components) are often exactly
what SIGINT is interested in. They are also exactly what gets lost in subsampling.

How can we find rare events with limited memory?	◄

Can we take ‘beyond supervised learning’ to the limit, and find a way to classify normal ◄
and abnormal behaviour from the data itself, without needing to train a classifier? A simple
idea would be to choose an N in advance, classify the first N items in the stream as ‘normal’,
then use a positive-only learning algorithm to build a classifier to apply to the remainder of
the stream. Can we do anything more sophisticated to bootstrap a classifier out of the data ◄
itself?

Work from	at LLNL is relevant to this. He is learning a Gaussian mixture

model on cyber data with particle filters and asking about newness by looking at probability
density. Can we ask about tail area instead? This question has also been posed to the 2011
NSASAG [W28].

Can we track new small connected components? This might be a group of targets who have ◄
dumped their old SIM cards and replaced them.

5.4.2	Background distributions for significance tests

We have already touched on the idea that we want a measure of surprise when we find outliers
(section 5.2.2), and for this we want to know the background distribution: what does ‘normal’
look like, and how can we quantify that? This section gives some specific examples of outlying
behaviour that we look for, and for which we therefore want to find an empirical background
distribution. Any information along these lines could also feed into tests in Dynamic Graph.

What is the distribution of the number of common neighbours of two nodes in a graph as a ◄
function of their degree? This is one way to try to measure the strength of association of two
entities.

What is the distribution of component sizes? Terrorist cells and other target groups have ◄
been found because they form small components (or ‘closed loops’, to use the analysts’ term)
isolated from the giant component. How surprising is it to see a node in a component of a
given size? Likewise for other measures of connectivity.

What significance do various CHART BREAKER [W6] relationship scores have? This ◄
involves looking at an email hypergraph, rather than just a simple graph.

5.4.3	Window sizing

We often want to pull off a finite chunk from a stream, either for offline analysis or for change
detection metrics.

How should we choose the window size? Is there a happy medium between a narrow window ◄

(little data, so large variance) and a large window (concept drift, so large variance) that leads
to small sample variance?

Can we do something akin to ANOVA analysis to look at the effect on sample variance of ◄
sample size versus concept drift across different window sizes?

5.5	Profiling and correlation

We are often interested in finding nodes that behave like a target node: they might be following
the same modus operandi, or be another selector for a known target.

5.5.1	Correlations

With millions of entities, there is no hope of storing useful information on all pairs.

Is there a sparse approximation to a correlation matrix?	◄

AUTO ASSOC [W2] scores may provide a relevant example of a large correlation matrix.
These are similarity scores for pairs of target detection identifiers or TDIs, which are unique,
persistent identifiers associated to particular users or machines that indicate their presence on
the network: the aim of AUTO ASSOC is to find out when multiple TDIs belong to the same
user or machine. See section 3.3.2 for further discussion of association scores.

Can we keep an approximate list of the top N nodes most closely correlated with a given ◄
target node?

There is also the underlying question of how to score association. This is not strictly about
EDA on streams, but looking at how existing scores perform on streaming data might suggest
ways of improving them.

How can we score the association between two nodes? CHART BREAKER [W6] gives ◄
a significance score between pairs of nodes based on emails exchanged. There is an ad hoc
balancing between the value of an email where one side is sole recipient, cc’d or bcc’d (cf.
assigning weights to golds, silvers and bronzes in medal tables). Is there a method with a
better theoretical justification behind it?

Can we correlate the ‘busyness profiles’ of nodes, for example to provide situational aware- ◄
ness of a DDOS attack?

5.5.2	Finding behaviour that matches a model

Frequently we have a modus operandi known to be used by particular targets, and we want to
search for events matching that model in streaming data. Recent work by	on

low-rank approximations [E1] may be useful: she has a general framework called CPD analysis
that uses tensor decompositions to model multi-variable data and extract meaningful factors
as rank 1 tensors. Reducing dimension should make it easier to match up features. (This also
has applications to link prediction, which is pertinent in SIGINT applications where we expect
to have a lot of missing data.)

If a target disposes of his phone and buys a new one, can we rediscover it in data?	◄

Can we find IP addresses fitting the profile of, for example, a box engaged in a denial-of-	◄

service attack, or an implanted box beaconing to a C2 server?

Mathematically, this may come down to something like solving an approximate subgraph
isomorphism problem. CSEC’s 2010 SAWUNEH did some exploratory work on data mining for
cyber defence [I82], which gives some concrete examples of malicious behaviour to look for in
events data. There is also existing work along these lines for botnet detection in CROUCHING
SQUIRREL [I27, I71], and it may be interesting to compare with external work on streaming
botnet detection by adaptive sampling [E45].

5.6	Easy entry problems

This section has some ideas for problems that do not have high entry requirements in terms of
reading up on existing literature or doing lots of preliminary data manipulation: they might
be a good place to start for people who like to get into things quickly.

Maths route:

•	Motif finding

•	Properties of trusses and their generalizations

•	Finding outliers

Data route:

•	Visualization

•	Streaming QQ plots

5.7	Relevant data

This problem set has the advantage that EDA is needed for any and all of the streaming
communication datasets we have available: the telephony, email, HRMap and cyber datasets
all readily map to graphs (or hypergraphs), and present challenges for all four areas: streaming
graph analytics, visualization, outlier detection and correlation. There is also a graph of the
links between Wikipedia articles (appendix F.2.3) in case researchers want a static graph of links
to compare with the dynamic graph of clicks provided by HRMap. Appendices F.1.3, F.1.1,
F.1.2 and F.1.6 describe some particularly appropriate datasets, but most of the datasets in
appendix F could usefully be explored.

Since EDA is such a general requirement, it is equally possible to work with unclassified
data sets. Appendix F.2.2 describes a dataset being analysed by the UKVAC (see section 5.8.2):
besides being another source of events data that is somewhat different in nature to commu-
nication data, it would also be useful to work with this data should any collaboration develop
with UKVAC participants.

6	Streaming Expiring Graphs

6.1	Introduction

Streams of transactional events often arise in SIGINT problems. A classic example would be
telephony events where we have a directed event from one telephone number to another when
we detect a phone call. In this case we would typically have a relatively small number of target
numbers we are interested in and would collect the events around these - we call this a seeded
graph. An event or transaction is a (normally timestamped) observation of an edge, and so
for each edge in the graph we may see multiple events. In some recent problems, for example
electronic attack events, we have been interested in looking for structure in the entire graph.
A denial of service attack might be visible for example as a vertex which suddenly has many
incoming edges.

We have techniques for handling the seeded case in a streaming way, expiring old edges
and maintaining a current view of a graph, for example GCHQ Dynamic Graph [W12] and
associated simulations completed by NSA [I2]. This research area is about investigating the
second case where we are interested in tracking the full graph as it varies over time. We imagine
that we want to expire old events or edges somehow. This might be by maintaining a buffer
of the most recent n events, maintaining the n most recently seen edges, or by decaying edge
weights over time and expiring those with the lowest weights. Other decay strategies might also
be appropriate. For some problems we may not need to store the full window, and can instead
find an analytic that produces equivalent results. Any algorithm should ideally parallelise so
that we aren’t restricted to the memory or network bandwidth available on a single computer.

In a dynamic graph problem the typical aim is to maintain a data structure for answering
queries whilst also receiving updates to the graph. The aim is to maintain information that
can be updated efficiently given the stream of changes to the graph, and to avoid total re-
computation for each query. We say a graph problem is fully dynamic if the updates include
both insertions and deletions of edges. A problem permitting only one type of update (insertion
or deletion) is sometimes described as partially dynamic. Some literature uses the term evolving
graph instead. An old but good overview of some dynamic graph algorithms is given in [E14].

An expiring graph can be thought of as being a dynamic graph where we allow arbitrary
edge insertion, but edge deletion is restricted to one of a small subset of the edges, for example
the oldest or lowest weight edges.

As in the EDA on Streams problem (section 5), we expect solutions to run in a streaming
fashion on the DISTILLERY platform. We are also interested in how we might bootstrap such
an algorithm using a map-reduce job on a Hadoop cluster where that makes sense, however
this is not the main focus.

6.1.1	The Problems

In section 6.2 we list graph properties which we would like to be able to find and track as the
graph evolves. We allow some freedom in how the graph evolves. Edges may decay over time
with low weight edges being expired. We might maintain the most recently observed edges,
or we might retain a window of the most recent events, either chosen to be a fixed size or
over a fixed time period. We expect different problems to be possible with different expiry

mechanisms so the choice should be considered separately for each problem.

For each property we list, we are interested in answers to the questions posed in section
6.3. We list some further extensions in section 6.4.

6.2	Properties to find and track

In this section we assume a graph G(V, E) with n vertices in vertex set V and with edge set
E. We use dv to mean the degree of vertex v.

6.2.1	Component Structure

In most SIGINT graphs we empirically expect to find a giant component containing most of
the vertices (see for example [I34] and [I33]). It has been shown in the past that examining
the remaining components can yield valuable intelligence [I32]. For example a HUMINT agent
and their handler might use specific phones to speak to each other and never use these phones
otherwise. Terrorist cells might have separate phones for calling each other; again these would
never contact numbers in the giant component of the graph. We are therefore interested in
finding these small components (note that this interest is very sensitive).

Component tracking has been studied for dynamic graphs for example [E2].

Can we identify small components in an expiring graph? The query could include a time ◄
since which edges should be considered, or such a time might be implicit in the expiry strategy.

Can we track the component structure of an expiring graph to be able to answer a query	◄

such as “is there a path between A and B with all edges having been observed since time t?”

Given an approximate solution to these problems, can we provide an error estimate, for ◄
example upper and lower bounds? These might for example take the form of the maximum
proportion of queries for which we provide the wrong answer.

6.2.2	Graph Distance

The distance between two nodes in a graph can be an indicator of how related they are, for
example in contact-chaining analysts will often look at the two-hop contact network of a target.

For some graphs we might like to be able to answer queries of the form “what is the distance
from A to B with all edges having been observed since time t?”. We can think of the graph as
being either directed or undirected, and weighted or unweighted. We would typically remove
high degree vertices before asking such a question. External work in the area includes [E15].

Give an approximate answer for the distance between any two vertices for edges observed ◄
since time t, including error bounds.

A related problem is to provide alerts when the graph distance between two sets of vertices
goes below some threshold, for example if two groups of targets are seen to communicate.

Can we track the distance between two (possibly dynamic) sets of vertices. Can we efficiently
identify when two sets of vertices have a length d path between them?

6.2.3	Cliques and other motifs

In section 5.2.2 we describe the problem of counting cliques and other motifs. Network analysis
suggests that some structure may be important for example in target identification or malware

detection. Where we expect a structure to be rare, the appearance of such structures may be
an anomaly we wish to investigate.

In telephony data, cliques or near cliques with few connections to the remainder of the
graph is a known MO of certain target groups. The members are in frequent contact with each
other, but rarely call others. In the case where they never call other numbers we describe it
as a closed loop (see section 6.2.1 on the preceding page). Can we find and track cliques or ◄
near-cliques which are persistent in the graph over time? If a new number enters a clique (or
near clique) at the same time as another member ceases communication we might infer that a
user has changed phone number. Can we identify such occurrences?	◄

Bounds here are likely to be based around the size of the clique found, for example given
there exists a k-clique in the graph what size sub-clique does the algorithm guarantee to find?

Our graph also has a time element - edges are observed repeatedly. Given a timestamp, ◄
can we extract all cliques or near-cliques of some size where all edges have been observed since
that timestamp? Can we do this for other motifs?	◄

6.2.4	Centrality Measures

The centrality of a vertex in a graph measures the relative importance of that vertex. For
example it might show how important a person is within a social network, or how important
a website is in terms of reachability of other sites. Common centrality measures include the
degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality.

The simplest is the degree centrality, defined for each vertex as the number of incident links,
scaled by the possible number, that is

Cd (v)

dv

n — 1 ’

Tracking the (approximate) degree centrality in O(n) space is relatively easy without expiry	◄

of edges, but can we track it for each vertex in the case of an expiring graph, for both the
weighted and unweighted cases.

The vertex betweenness centrality of vertex v is (informally) the proportion of all shortest
paths in the graph which pass through vertex v. If aab is the number of shortest paths between
a and b, and aab(v) is the number of shortest paths between a and b passing through v then

Cb (v)

E

a=v=b€V

Vab(v)

®ab

We are not particularly interested in the global betweenness centrality, but would be inter-
ested in ways to track it for specific subgraphs, for example the 2-hop graph around some set
of seed vertices.

Is it possible to maintain an approximation to the betweenness centrality for a set of vertices ◄
as the graph (and the vertex set) evolves? Some internal work in this field is described in [I46].

The eigenvector centrality scores nodes in such a way that high scoring nodes contribute
more score to their neighbours than low scoring nodes. A variant is the Google PageRank
algorithm [E30]. In the basic case, the eigenvector centrality of vertex v is the corresponding
entry in the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of G corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.

Again we aren’t directly interested in the global eigenvector centrality measures, but would
be interested to track local variants, for example Personalized PageRank or the internally
developed KL-Relative PageRank [W45].

Can we track any personalized variants of the eigenvector centrality for some (possibly ◄
changing) set of vertices in an expiring graph? There has been internal work on updating
eigenvectors and eigenvalues as more edges are observed at the Information Processing SCAMP
in 2009, see [I81], along with a report on its possible implementation [I56].

6.3 Questions relevant to all properties

6.3.1	Approximation

Typically it is not necessary to know the exact values of the properties listed above, and we can
make do with an approximation. For an approximation to be useful it should include some form
of error bounds, although the form these take will depend on the specific problem. They could
include e-6 bounds, strict upper and lower bounds, errors with a known statistical distribution,
etc.

Are there approximate solutions to any of the problems listed? Where an exact solution ◄
exists, how does the computational cost (time and memory) compare?

6.3.2	Computational Cost

For each of the problems listed in section 6.2 we would like to know the cost of evaluating the
properties in this way. For our purposes cost is CPU time and memory usage as a function of
the data size (asymptotics are important but we also care about the constants as derived from
experiments).

We typically work under the semi-streaming graph model where we allow ourselves
O(n log(n)) space. For example, we might imagine storing a component ID for each vertex.

For most problems it would be possible to collect a window of data from the stream and re-
compute the required statistics at the desired query interval. Whether this is practical depends
on the window size, the frequency of updates to the graph, and the frequency (and latency)
with which an answer to the query must be returned. The trade-offs should be considered -
incremental updates might take more compute overall, but in situations where we can take
some automated action based on the results then we might be willing to accept the cost to gain
the low latency.

In most settings it is unnecessary to know the answer to a question for every edge addition
or deletion, and it is instead sufficient to be able to compute the answer after each batch update,
so long as those updates are sufficiently fast.

Furthermore, the online process may track and store data to allow efficient updates, but
to get the desired answer may then require us to further process the data we have stored.

We might then choose to run this further processing less often, for instance at the request of
an analyst. This is a perfectly valid approach, and could be particularly valuable if the data
structure lends itself to answering multiple types of query.

Concrete questions include:

• What is the (mean) cost of an update? What is the worst-case cost?	◄

•	At what query frequency does the total computational cost of incremental updates become ◄
lower than the cost of total re-computation on each query? How does this depend on
batch size?

•	How does the computational cost vary depending on features of the graph, for example ◄
diameter or average distance.

•	How does the cost vary depending on the window size or the decay rate?	◄

6.3.3	Expiry Policy

As well as affecting the speed and computational cost of an algorithm, the choice of expiry
mechanism will affect the accuracy of the results.

For windowed data, how should we choose the window size to ensure we get realistic results ◄
at a reasonable speed? Is it possible to dynamically change the window size?	◄

For decaying data, how should we chose our decay rate to maintain realistic results? Can ◄
we change the decay rate without restarting the algorithm?

6.4	Further Questions

6.4.1	Parallel and Distributed processing

For high rate data feeds it may be necessary to process the data on multiple nodes of a cluster.

The data feed would be split between nodes and these streams cannot be combined until their
rate is sufficiently reduced. Which of the graph properties can be computed in a parallel way? ◄
Some SIGINT data sources are split between multiple geographical sites, with limited band-
width between them. Is it possible to solve any of these problems for the (virtual) stream of ◄
joined data? In this case we would expect to process each feed at the collection site and send
a much smaller set of data between sites, either periodically or in order to answer a query.

6.4.2	Bootstrapping

For some properties it may be possible to get an initial approximation to the correct values by
running a map-reduce query on an events Hadoop cluster. Can we make use of bootstrapping to ◄
improve the efficiency of our processing? This might be particularly relevant when we process
the stream in parallel and wish to split the vertices over multiple nodes of a cluster with each
node being responsible for some proportion of the vertices.

6.4.3	Anomaly Detection

For many of the properties we wish to compute, we would also like to be able to produce an
alert for anomalies in the data. For example, in the web graph, if a vertex is suddenly connected
to a large number of other vertices this may indicate a denial of service attack. Alerts may
be used to trigger additional processing, for example capture and storage of relevant data or
additional processing to categorise the event. Some internal research in this area can be found
in [I20].

Can we detect significant changes in the properties we are tracking? How soon are we able ◄

to detect the change after it initially occurs?

6.4.4	Resilience

Over time our collection posture changes. Bearers are tasked and de-tasked, and
systems can fail. This can have a significant effect, especially when monitoring for
How are the algorithms affected by variations in data volumes?

If we identify that a change is due to a processing failure, can we account for
generating future alerts once the processing resumes? See for example [I10].

6.4.5	Queries on graphs with attributes

Many SIGINT graphs have some form of attributes associated with vertices and edges, for
example the location of a phone. It can be useful to answer queries where we restrict ourselves
to vertices with a particular value for some attribute. Is it possible to modify your algorithm ◄
to enable queries on vertices with particular attributes?

6.5	Relevant Data

Any streaming graphical data is suitable for these problems, giving a variety of options. Ex-
amples include HRMap, telephony, email, SQUEAL alerts and IP flow metadata. All provide a
stream of events with some notion of a source and destination vertex, along with the timestamp
of the event.

In addition we have various reference datasets. For example section F.3.1 describes a
database of websites of interest to counter terrorism and BROAD OAK lists known target
phone numbers and email addresses (see section F.3.2). These could be used to identify if an
extracted graph structure has a higher density of targets than would be expected.

The idea of wanting to process a stream of edges is not specific to the intelligence community,
and so external collaboration should be possible given a suitable dataset.

6.6	Collaboration Points

There are the following potential collaboration opportunities both within and outside the in-
telligence community.

KACHINA: Sandia National Lab in the USA has a multi-year effort called KACHINA which
includes the Questa project to look at large graph processing for defence analysis. They

A Ways of working

This section gives a few thoughts on ways of working. The aim is to build on the positive culture
already established in the Institute’s crypt work. HIMR researchers are given considerable
freedom to work in whatever way suits them best, but we hope these ideas will provide a good
starting-point.

A.1 Five-eyes collaboration

As on the crypt side, we hope that UKUSA collaboration will be a foundation-stone of the data
mining effort at HIMR. This problem book is full of links to related research being carried out
by our five-eyes partners, and researchers are very strongly urged to pursue collaborative angles
wherever possible—above all, to get to know the people working on the same problems and
build direct relationships. Researchers are encouraged to attend and present at community-
wide conferences (principally SANAR and ACE), as funding and opportunity allows.

We hope that informal short visits to and from HIMR will also be a normal part of data
mining life. HIMR has a tradition of holding short workshops to focus intensively on particular
topics, where possible with participation from experts across the five eyes community. Fre-
quently these are held during university vacations, to allow our cleared academic consultants
to take part. Each summer, HIMR hosts a SWAMP: a two-month long extended workshop
on (traditionally) two topics of high importance, similar to the SCAMPs organized by IDA.
We hope that HIMR researchers will feel inspired to suggest possible data mining sub-topics
for future SWAMPs.

A.2 Knowledge sharing

Inevitably, there is a formal side to reporting results: technical papers, conference talks, code
handed over to corporate processing, and so on. But informal dissemination of ideas, results,
progress, set-backs and mistakes is also extremely valuable. This is especially true at HIMR,
for several reasons.

•	There is a high turnover of people, and it is important that a researcher’s ideas (even the
half-baked ones) don’t leave with him or her.

•	Academic consultants form an important part of the research effort: they may only have
access to classified spaces a few times a year for a few days at a time, so being able to
catch up quickly with what’s happened since their last visit is crucial to help them make
the most of their time working with us.

•	HIMR is physically detached from the rest of GCHQ, and it’s important to have as many
channels of communication as possible—preferably bidirectional!—so that this detach-
ment doesn’t become isolation. The same goes even more so for second party partners as
well.

In HIMR’s METEOR SHOWER work, knowledge sharing is now primarily accomplished
through two compartmented wikis hosted by CCR Princeton. For data mining, there should
be more flexibility, since almost none of the methods and results produced will be ECI, and

in fact they will usually be STRAP1 or lower. Paradoxically, however, the fact that work can
be more widely shared can mean that there is less of a feeling of a community of interest with
whom one particularly aims to share it: witness the fact that there is no shining model of data
mining knowledge sharing elsewhere in the community for HIMR to copy!

We suggest that as far as possible, data miners at HIMR build up a set of pages on GCWiki
(which can then be read and edited by all five-eyes partners) in a similar way to how crypt
research is recorded on the CCR wikis. They can then encourage contacts at GCHQ and
elsewhere to watch, edit and comment on relevant pages. In particular, the practice of holding
regular bull sessions10 and taking live wiki notes during them is highly recommended.

If any researchers feel so inclined, GCBlog and the other collaborative tools on GCWeb are
available, and quite suitable for all STRAP1 work. For informal communications with people
from MCR and ICTR, there is a chat-room called himr_dm: anyone involved in the HIMR data
mining effort can keep this open in the background day by day. There is also a distillery
room that is sadly under-used: in principle, it discusses SPL and the corporate DISTILLERY
installations.

For any STRAP2 work that comes along, there are currently no good collaborative options:
creating an email distribution list would be one possibility.

A.3 Academic engagement

The first test for HIMR’s classified work must be its applicability and usefulness for SIGINT,
but given that constraint, GCHQ is keen to encourage HIMR researchers to build relationships
and collaborate with academic data miners, and publish their results in the open literature.
Of course, security and policy will impose some red lines on what exactly is possible, but the
basic principle is that when it comes to data mining, SIGINT data is sensitive, but generally-
applicable techniques used to analyse that data often are not. Just about everyone nowadays,
whether they are in academia, industry or government, has to deal with big data, and by and
large they all want to do the same things to it: count it, classify it and cluster it. If researchers
develop a new technique that can be published in an open journal once references to SIGINT
are excised, and after doing a small amount of extra work to collect results from applying it to
an open source dataset too, then this should be a win-win situation: the researcher adds to his
or her publication tally, and HIMR builds a reputation for data mining excellence.

Of course, there may be occasions when publication is not appropriate, for example where
a problem comes from a very specific SIGINT situation with no plausible unclassified analogy.
Day-to-day contact with the Deputy Director at HIMR should flag up cases like this early on.
There are also cases where we feel we have an algorithmic advantage over the outside that is
worth trying to maintain, and this can be further complicated if equity from other partners is
involved, or if a technique brings in ideas from areas like crypt where strict secrecy is the norm.
The Deputy Director should be consulted before discussing anything that might be classified in
a non-secure setting: he or she can further refer the question to Ops Policy if necessary. Over

10Informal meetings at blackboards where people briefly describe work they have been doing and problems
they have encountered, with accompanying discussion from others in the room. The rules: people who wish to
speak bid the number of minutes they need (including time for questions). Talks are ordered from low to high
bid, with ties broken arbitrarily. You can ask questions at any time. You can leave at any time. If you manage
to take the chalk from the speaker, you can give the talk.

time, researchers will build up a good idea of what is sensitive and what is not, but in the first
instance, erring on the side of caution is a sound starting point where classified information is
involved.

Similarly, if there are grey areas about when work should count as part of a researcher’s
classified or unclassified effort, this can be settled by an informal conversation with the HIMR
Director or Deputy Director.

B DISTILLERY

DISTILLERY is a project to deliver a platform for near-real-time streaming analytics. It
is a research partnership between NSA and IBM Research, with GCHQ also having been
involved for a number of years. DISTILLERY was released by IBM as a commercial product
in 2010 as IBM InfoSphere Streams, often shortened to just Streams. We use the three terms
synonymously. For more on the DISTILLERY platform, and links to plenty of other useful
pages see [W11].

Central to the DISTILLERY platform is the stream processing paradigm. We use the
terminology of the Streams documentation. A Streams application is made up of one or more
composite operators. A composite operator contains one or more operators, each of which
has zero or more input ports and zero or more output ports. Data takes the form of tuples
conforming to a schema, where the schema defines the names and types of the entries which
make up a tuple. Streams of tuples flow along the edges of the flow graph between the operator
ports and the operators carry out some kind of transformation on these streams. When built
and launched into the Streams platform, operators are placed in a series of processing elements
or PEs connected according to the application flow graph. Each PE contains one or more
operators (by default exactly one, but we can combine multiple operators into a single PE for
efficiency).

Crucially, we can process data as it arrives. If we know in advance what questions we would
like to ask of the data then we may never need to store the data. Instead, we build a processing
flow to answer the question on the stream of data. Our output is a stream of answers. As well
as saving storage, processing data provides other advantages. An obvious one is near-real-time
tipping. Given some event of interest, we can alert an analyst as soon as we observe that
event. We can typically provide a tip-off within a second of the event occurring, although the
latency of the analyst is somewhat higher. However we do not restrict ourselves to tipping a
human. Observing an event might cause us to take some other action, for example collecting
more detailed data for identifiers that appear in the initial event.

Streams applications are written in SPL, the Streams Processing Language [W40], and are
run on InfoSphere Streams version 2. Older applications were written in SPADE and run on
InfoSphere Streams version 1. We are currently converting our applications from SPADE to
SPL, and we plan for most new applications to be written in SPL.

B.1 When would I use InfoSphere Streams?

Stream based processing is useful any time where you want to produce results as soon as possible
after the relevant events occur or when we cannot reasonably store all the data required for a
problem. In these situations we can use Streams to handle the plumbing between our operators.
It provides parallelism over multiple hosts in a cluster whilst also providing some resiliency
against system failures. Through the use of Import and Export operators an application can
be developed and deployed in stages, and data streams can be shared with other users.

Import operators will also allow you to take advantage of the data streams already available
on the cluster. In this case, someone else will already have arranged for the feed to be delivered
from our front-end collection systems, and your application need not be concerned with format
changes.

Access to a DISTILLERY cluster is via ssh, and you will initially use the BHDIST
cluster (see below). Use one of

Once you log on for the first time you should go through the
steps listed on the getting started GCWiki page [W16], although the following steps should be
sufficient to get you started.

Configure key based ssh access (accept the defaults presented by ssh-keygen):

ssh-keygen -t dsa
cd ~/.ssh

cat id_dsa.pub > authorized_keys
chmod 600 *

You should then be able to type ‘ssh localhost’ and it won’t ask for a password. This is essential
as DISTILLERY uses ssh to launch commands and processes on all nodes (even when running
only on localhost).

Add the following to your .bashrc file:

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
. /etc/bashrc
fi

umask 0027

export JAVA_HOME=/opt/ibm/java-x86_64-60/

export ECLIPSE_HOME=/opt/eclipse-spl

export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:opt/eclipse-spl:$PATH

export STREAMS_SPLPATH=/opt/distillery/toolkits
source /

Configure a streams public/private keypair (to avoid needing a password to stop/start jobs)
with:

streamtool genkey

Set up a hostfile to tell Streams which hosts to use. The hosts file is in

e and for now should contain a single line with the host you’re
using but in the blackhole.net domain as this uses a faster network switch, e.g.

You should now be able to follow the SPL Introductory Tutorial linked from

For using the Eclipse tools, including the ability to view your jobs in a flow graph, then use
eclipse with	This should be in your path if you followed

the instructions above. Figure 5 shows an example of multiple jobs connected together in a
shared DISTILLERY instance, as seen through the Streams Live Graph view in Eclipse.

Many people choose to run a VNC session on the cluster to provide a desktop environment.
For instructions see the DISTILLERY pages on GCWiki.

The two main clusters used for research work are listed in table 2. To get an account on
either contact

B.4 Data

Data typically arrives into a DISTILLERY cluster via either a UDP or TCP socket from our
front-end processing systems. UDP is used where we need to avoid delays in our processing
causing delays earlier in the processing chain - instead we just drop the extra data. We are
moving to using TCP and then using a threaded port on the next operator so we can measure
our data losses (see section B.5.1 on page 58).

Your home directory is shared over the cluster, as is	. Applications need

to be run from a shared location so all nodes can access them. Results should be saved to
rather than your home directory as the filesystem is local to the cluster.

B.5 Conventions

The DISTILLERY clusters contain operational prototypes as well as development code, so it
is important to consider the impact on others when running jobs.

When running jobs on the live data feeds, try to do initial processing and data reduction
on the same host as the data import to avoid unnecessary network use. Avoid causing back
pressure to the live feeds - see section B.5.1. Ideally you should test your code on a small
sample before connecting to the live data feeds, although this may not always be possible.

B.5.1 Use threaded ports on shared data

If the incoming data rate is faster than you can process then by default you will cause the
incoming data to slow down, causing back pressure. If you are reading from a shared data
stream then this affects everyone reading from that stream - all processing will be slowed
down. This may cause data to be lost further up the chain, for example at the point where it
is received from the front-end probes.

To avoid causing this problem, you should normally configure the first operator of a job
to drop tuples if it has too many already waiting to be processed. Typically this would be an
Import() operator, which is configured as follows:

stream<SomeTupleType> I1 = ImportO {

param subscription : DataFeed == "SomeData";

}

stream<myschema> I2 = Functor(Il) {

config threadedPort : queue(I1, Sys.DropLast);

}

The queue function has an optional third parameter which specifies the buffer size (in tuples),
and the second option can be replaced by Sys.DropFirst.

When reading from a file then you should not set such a buffering configuration, since you
want to read the data as fast as you can process it but without discarding any tuples.

B.5.2 Operator Toolkits and Namespaces

SPL (DISTILLERY) code is stored in toolkits. These split into two broad types - tookits
of operators and toolkits containing applications. The Five Eyes repositories of toolkits are
held in MadForge and are described at

. When we wish to share our operators (typically once they are
tried and tested) then we will add them to MadForge. Before that we store the code in a
Git repository on http://github.ar.gchq, with the repository name matching the toolkit
name but prefixed with “spl-”. Instructions for creating a new repository can be found at

Most of the repositories get built at least once a week and deployed to the cluster. To add
a repository to the build list contact	or	To have

new versions of your toolkit be automatically deployed you must ensure that you increment the
toolkit version number. Toolkits are installed to /opt/distillery/toolkits and can then be

used in your applications. Rather than hard-code this path we put it into the STREAMS_SPLPATH
environment variable.

Toolkits containing operators are placed in the gchq.* namespace, for example
gchq.ingest contains the TcpLineReader operator for multi-threaded reading of SIGINT data.
Application toolkits are in the gchq.app.* namespace to differentiate them. These are not in-
stalled into /opt/distillery/toolkits but are instead checkout out into /streams/apps if
you want to run them.

One particularly important toolkit is	. Despite the name, this is in fact

installed into	and contains the schemas for the data available in

the cluster. This is needed when importing data into your application. As an example, HRMap
data matches the HRMapRecord schema. Details for all the datasets described in section F can be

C Hadoop

Hadoop is a software framework that supports static data-intensive distributed applications.
Its design is heavily based on that of Google’s infrastructure as disclosed in [E10]. It is designed
to be scalable rather than fast and efficient. This means that for any given task there is likely
to exist a more efficient solution. However the ease of parallelism more than counteracts this
in most cases. In this model of parallelism the computation is shipped to the data, rather than
data to computation, therefore saving large amounts of network traffic. Typically Hadoop is
installed across a cluster of computers, which are often referred to as clouds. Indeed the only
reason to install it on a single computer is for testing purposes.

Hadoop consists of two main components, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
and MapReduce. As a user it should not be necessary to worry about how the file system
is implemented. Instead one can consider it to act just like a very large filesystem. However
should one wish to use Hadoop to process data then knowledge of MapReduce is required.
Fortunately the key concepts of MapReduce are simple and easily understood. As the name
suggests there are two stages to any MapReduce job—a Map and a Reduce. In the map stage
one receives successive input records. For each input one produces zero, one or many output
records in the form of key-value pairs. These output records then go into a shuffle phase, in
which all records are sorted so that the reduce stage receives all records with a common key
together. This reduce group is then processed together and again zero, one or many output
records may be produced. As the entire output of the Mapper is being sorted it is possible to
perform a secondary sort to provide data to the Reducer in an advantageous order. This is
done by specifying that grouping should only consider part of the key, whereas ordering should
consider all of it. A common use of this is to provide time ordered data in a reducer for a
particular identifier.

The Hadoop framework is written in Java. Java is therefore a popular choice for writing
Hadoop MapReduce applications. Using Java one has access to the full functionality of Hadoop
and is recommended for sustainable code. However it is not necessary to know any Java to get
MapReduce jobs running on Hadoop using the Streaming package. Streaming is invoked from
the command line on a Hadoop node. Any script or program that accepts data on STDIN and
outputs it to STDOUT can be specified as a Mapper or Reducer. This significantly lowers the
entry barrier and is ideal for quickly trying out ideas where the full Java treatment seems like
overkill.

C.1 When would I use Hadoop?

The short answer is whenever you want to batch process a large amount of static data. There
is not really any other option for such computations within GCHQ.

A slightly longer answer is that Hadoop clusters are where GCHQ has chosen to keep its
bulk events data. This is due to the large amount of data processing power Hadoop offers. With
hundreds of hard disks working simultaneously multiple gigabytes can be read per second. This
allows the processing of the multi-terabyte datasets we intercept. By having the data in its raw
state it is possible to ask a huge number of different questions of it. This can be contrasted
with the QFDs which also store very large amounts of data, but are databases optimised for
a specific type of analyst queries. The QFDs therefore do not offer a sensible data mining

platform.

Hadoop generally excels when your algorithm can be expressed in a small number of MapRe-
duce steps. It is less efficient when implementing iterative algorithms. This is because between
iterations all state must be written down to disk and then read back in again. This extra
I/O cost can easily end up swamping the time taken to perform the computations. Sometimes
there may be no other way of performing an algorithm given the size of the data and the only
solution is patience11.

C.2 Documentation and Training

The standard Hadoop documentation is available linked from
This consists of:

•	A MapReduce Tutorial that shows you how to write MapReduce applications in Java.

•	An introduction to Hadoop Streaming. Although not a full tutorial all the information
you need to run Streaming jobs is there.

•	An overview of the Hadoop command line arguments.

•	The Java documentation of the Hadoop API. If writing Hadoop in Java this is extremely
useful.

The Hadoop page on GCWiki [W20] has many resources, including:

•	6 lectures and 2 exercises from Cloudera, a Hadoop consultancy company.

•	An overview of Hadoop by IBM’s Jimeng Sun.

Tom White’s book Hadoop: The Definitive Guide is probably the best book currently
available on Hadoop. It is also available on NSA’s Safari book library [W35].

Classroom based training should also be available. TDB have organised internal training
led by GCHQ employees. Some people have also attended a multi-day training course offered
by Cloudera.

C.3 Logging on and Getting Started

Access to Hadoop clusters is via ssh. You will ssh to an edge node. These are not part of the
compute cluster but do allow you to submit jobs and interact with HDFS.

Instructions for accessing SUN STORM, the largest cluster, are available at

The other clusters are detailed in table 3.

Some useful aliases for your .bashrc are given below. Adding these will save you a huge
amount of typing and make interacting with HDFS feel more like using a regular filesystem.

11ICTR-DMR are currently developing Bagel an implementation of Google’s Pregel distributed graph mining
solution. While still in its early stages Bagel keeps its state in memory and therefore avoids this extra I/O cost
between steps.

C.5 Conventions and restrictions

The three corporate clusters are all configured similarly. This subsection refers to their
configurations—for the research clusters all bets are off and ICTR-DMR should advise you
of any restrictions should you gain access.

C.5.1 Scheduler

The clusters all have the Fair Scheduler installed [W19]. This replaces the vanilla FIFO that
Hadoop has installed by default. Fair scheduling is a method of assigning resources to jobs
such that all jobs get, on average, an equal share of resources over time. When there is a single
job running, that job uses the entire cluster. When other jobs are submitted, task slots that
free up are assigned to the new jobs, so that each job gets roughly the same amount of CPU
time.

Each user (and special processing users) are assigned their own pool. The scheduler tries to
give each pool an equal amount of time on the cluster. Processing users also have a minimum
number of map and reduce slots below which they will not drop if they request them. Further
each user is restricted to having a single concurrent running job.

C.5.2 HDFS /user/yoursid space

On logging into a corporate cluster you will have a HDFS home directory created at
/user/yoursid. This is where the results of your Hadoop jobs will end up by default. That
is, if you don’t specify an absolute path,it will be taken relative to your home directory. Your
home directory has a size limit on it (believed to be 2TB). If you need more space than this
then you should contact the cluster administrators to find a solution.

C.6 Running Hadoop on the LID

It is discouraged to use either SUN STORM or HAGER AWEL for developing code as they
are both somewhat production systems. It is therefore a good idea to iron out bugs elsewhere
if possible to ensure your code will not bring the cluster down. The easiest way to do this
is probably on a pseudo-distributed Hadoop installation, following the instructions given in
the standard Hadoop documentation. If you wish to do this on the LID then you need to do
slightly more to get around issues with localhost not always being the same depending which
box you are on. Following these instructions should give you working Hadoop instance. If the
standard ports are already in use then more configuration properties need to be added. At this
point it’s probably best to either try another machine or ask for some advice.

1.	Make sure you can execute a passwordless ssh to your machine. This must be done using
the machine’s hostname, not localhost. This is because there are multiple different LID
servers, each with a different idea of what localhost is. By adding one machine’s localhost
to the known_hosts file you will cause yourself problems. If passwordless ssh does not
work execute the following commands.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ’’ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

2.	Choose a directory in which to install Hadoop. This should be somewhere visible from
all LID machines. Following shell scripting we will refer to this as $HADOOP_HOME. In fact
you might want to put the following into your .userprofile along with the other aliases
given previously.

export HADOOP_HOME=/path/to/Hadoop/dir/

3.	Untar the hadoop tarball into $HADOOP_HOME.

4.	In $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hadoop-env.sh add the line

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0/

5.	Make the directories $HADOOP_HOME/data and $HADOOP_HOME/name

6.	In $HADOOP_HOME/conf/hdfs-site.xml add the entries

<configuration>

<property>

<name>dfs.replication</name>

<value>1</value>

</property>

</property>

<property>

<name>dfs.name.dir</name>

<value>HADOOP_HOME/name</value>

</property>

</configuration>

Where HADOOPHOME is replaced with the Hadoop home directory. Using shell vari-
ables won’t work here as the configuration files are read verbatim.

7. In $HADOOP_HOME/conf/mapred-site.xml add the entries

<configuration>

<property>

<name>mapred.job.tracker</name>

<value>HOSTNAME:9001</value>

</property>

</configuration>

Where HOSTNAME is replaced with the hostname of the machine you are on.
8. In $HADOOP_HOME/conf/core-site.xml add the entries

<configuration>

<property>

<name>fs.default.name</name>

<value>HOSTNAME:9000</value>

</property>

</configuration>

Where HOSTNAME is replaced with the hostname of the machine you are on.

9. In $HADOOP_HOME/conf/masters and $HADOOP_HOME/conf/slaves replace localhost
with the hostname of the machine you are on.

10.	Run $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop namenode -format to format the namenode.

11.	Run $HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-all.sh to start the Hadoop daemons.

12.	To check this has worked OK go to http://HOSTNAME:50070/ to check on the status of
the namenode and http://HOSTNAME:50030/ for the jobtracker.

13.	Now you can try to run a toy Hadoop job. Copy the input files into the distrib-
uted filesystem: $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop fs -put conf input. Now run some of
the examples provided: $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar hadoop-*-examples.jar grep
input output ’dfs[a-z.] + ’.

When you log out of this LID session the Hadoop daemons will be killed by the logoff script.
You will therefore need to restart them in your next LID session. However each time you log
into the LID you cannot guarantee which machine you will be allocated. If you are allocated
a different machine to that where you installed Hadoop you will not be able to directly restart
it. Instead you will need to do so over ssh:

ssh HOSTNAME ’HADOOP_HOME/bin/start-all.sh’

Again HOSTNAME is the machine on which you originally installed Hadoop. You can then
submit jobs and interact with HDFS from any LID machine, i.e. including the one you currently
have a session on. Hadoop will then carry on running until the end of the next session you are
assigned on the machine on which you installed it.

C.7 Further help and resources

In OPC-MCR^^^^^^^^^^| is the best contact for Hadoop questions,	can also

offer advice, particularly on Streaming. Outside of MCR there is a large community of Hadoop
users and administrators. The best way to contact this community is probably through the
rough_diamond chatroom on the Jabber server.

There are a large number of resources available on GCWiki. Some highlights, in no partic-
ular order:

•	_(Work_Package): The main page for
SILVER LINING, the work package within TDB that provides Hadoop clusters. It links
to many places and may stay more up to date than this document.

•	_-_User_Guide: An initial user guide for the
SUN STORM cluster. However many of the tips hold in general across all Hadoop
clusters.

•	_-_Streaming_interface: A short guide to
user Hadoop Streaming with code examples to run on data on SUN STORM.

•	: SILVER LIBRARY is a library of Ha-
doop parsers, writables and other utility classes to simplify development of MapReduce
analytics in Java. This pages describes at least some of it. Links to Utilities and Search
are on the right hand side. The library is strongly recommded for Java MapReduce on
the corporate clusters as it has built in parsers that save users having to understand how
the events are structured.

D Other computing resources

There are various computing options available to HIMR researchers beyond the bulk data
sources of Hadoop and DISTILLERY. There is expertise in these environments at HIMR so we
only briefly document these options here. Further information can be found at [W22, W21].

Firstly researchers have access to the Microsoft Windows environment of VALHALLA.
VALHALLA is the standard desktop and provides email, Microsoft Office, web browsing, in-
stant messaging and a gateway to other systems. The /data/himr_dm/ filesystem should be
accessible in Windows with VALHALLA (at the time of writing the Windows mount location
is not known).

Instant messaging is accessible via the Pidgin application. Many employees of GCHQ can
be found online both for direct messaging and in chat rooms. The following chat rooms are
of particular note: himr_dm (HIMR data mining research), distillery (DISTILLERY users),
rough_diamond (Hadoop users), hecsupport (compute clusters queries) and lid_support (LID
support). Instructions for getting going on Pidgin can be found at [W29].

From VALHALLA researchers can access DISCOVER. This is GCHQ’s document repos-
itory. Literature for this research task has been filed at DISCOVER 10499535. Other sources
of information that are of particular note are the the collaborative GCWiki [W15], which con-
tains information about many GCHQ activities, and the Safari online bookshelf [W35], which
provides electronic versions of many technical books.

The primary interactive data analysis environment will be the Linux Interactive Desktop
(LID). The LID provides a remote desktop onto a RedHat Linux box. Various mathematical
tools such as R, Matlab, Mathematica, Maple, Sage and Magma are available. Scripting
languages are available: Perl is the most commonly used scripting language in GCHQ but
Python is starting to gain traction. Compilers are also available for C, C++ and Fortran. It
is worth noting that GCHQ have imported the general repository for R packages, CRAN, at
[W9] and implementations of many machine learning techniques can be found there.

There are two Linux compute clusters available. MOUNT MCKINLEY is probably
the machine of choice and has 652 compute nodes each with 8 cores, giving a total of 5216
cores. The cores are clocked at 2.4GHz. Each node has 32GB of RAM and there is a fast
interconnect between nodes. MOUNT MCKINLEY can be accessed from VALHALLA. The
catch with MOUNT MCKINLEY is there are few user tools available and hence it should
primarily be seen as a place to run compiled code (Perl and Python scripting is also available).
MOUNT MCKINLEY is also used for operational processing so researchers will need to abide
by conventions around HIMR’s use. An older compute cluster called SEPANG is also available
but is expected to be decommissioned shortly. SEPANG is firewalled from the rest of the GCHQ
network and does not have easy access to any of the data sources described; however it does
have a wide range of user tools installed and is reserved for HIMR’s sole use.

Both the LID and MOUNT MCKINLEY user nodes mount	If you want

to analyse data from Hadoop or DISTILLERY on LID or MOUNT MCKINLEY then you will
need to transfer the data with scp.

E Legalities

This appendix is intended as a brief guide to the legal information of most relevance to your
work at HIMR. However [W25] and your legalities training should be treated as the definitive
references.

E.1 Overview

GCHQ always complies with UK law12. In particular we are bound by the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) and Intelligence Services Act (ISA). RIPA requires GCHQ to
have arrangements in place to minimise its retention and dissemination of intercepted material.
RIPA also applies specific protection to the communications of people in the UK. ISA requires
GCHQ to have arrangements in place to ensure that it obtains or discloses information only in
the proper discharge of its functions or for the purpose of any criminal proceedings.

The complete and official compliance guide can be found in [W25]. In general we must be
able to demonstrate that our actions are both necessary and proportionate. We show that our
actions are necessary and proportionate by producing an accountable record for oversight and
audit. This typically takes the form of an HRA (Human Rights Act) justification. The Human
Rights Acts defines the basic rights everyone must have respected. In particular there is a right
to privacy which can only be violated “in the interests of national security, public safety or the
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of
health and morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” For GCHQ this
means we must justify our activities as being in the interests of national security, the economic
well-being of the UK, or in support of the prevention or detection of serious crime.

You should bear in mind that you have signed and are bound by the Official Secrets Act
(OSA). In particular you should take care in discussing or releasing potentially classified data
and techniques. If you are unsure on an item’s classification then you should seek guidance from
the data owner. Our data and information is also exempt from the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). All documents should carry the same caveat as this document.

As accessing the content of an individual’s communications is regarded as more invasive
than examining its metadata there are tighter restrictions imposed on such data. Content need
not necessarily be an email or phone call. For example, the content of a URI beyond the first
slash is considered content, as are the specifics of someone’s online mapping activity.

E.2 Procedures

We now highlight some specific procedures that should be followed when working with bulk
metadata.

Detailed policy guidance for corporate Hadoop clusters can be found at [W26]. We give the
most relevant information here. If you are extracting a dataset or performing analyses in a way
which is not expected to target an individual then there is no need to do anything. However if
the criteria specify individuals, or behaviours which are sufficiently precise that they apply to
only a few individuals, then you will need to complete a manual HRA log [W23]. You do not
need to complete this every time that you perform the same extraction, or perform follow-on

12The bulk of our work is also compliant with the policies and laws of five-eyes partners.

analysis using similar techniques and for a similar purpose, so long as you write your first log in
a way that is just general enough to cover your current work. Further if your analyses specify
five-eyes individuals or organisations, or if the query includes data that is designated as content
then you will need Sensitive Targeting Approval in addition to completing a manual HRA log.

When completing a manual HRA log the application name should be “SILVER_LINING”
if working on a Hadoop cluster. The reason should be “NS” (national security), a JIC pri-
ority of “1” and MIRANDA number of “20135” (“Intelligence in support of GCHQ research
work intended to maintain and develop general purpose capabilities in the field of target com-
munications in order to be able to meet such intelligence requirements as may be specified
now and in the future”). If you are developing new techniques then the query type should
be “QFD-DEVELOPMENT”, or if selecting data that focuses down to a few individuals then
“BULKEXTRACT”.

Queries in DISTILLERY should also be logged using the manual HRA logging service and
most of the guidance above applies. Until “DISTILLERY” is added to the list of applications,
please use “BLACK_HOLE”. The data source should be the source most closely matching the
feeds you are using, otherwise use “AD_HOC_EXTERNAL_DATA”. In order to complete the
“Number of Results Returned” field you will need to submit the log after you have run the
query - there is currently no way for you to update a manual HRA log.

F Data

In this appendix we summarise the datasets made available at the outset of this research.
Researchers are encouraged to work with GCHQ staff to find other datasets if required.

F.1 SIGINT events

Firstly we describe datasets of raw SIGINT events: typically these are available as live datasets
in Hadoop or DISTILLERY.

F.1.1 SALAMANCA

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP2 CHORDAL.

GCHQ collects telephone call record events from a wide variety of sources, and these are stored
in a database called SALAMANCA [W36]. This data is also fed to the SUN STORM cloud
and the BHDIST DISTILLERY cluster (and other DISTILLERY clusters). This data is a
relatively low rate feed of user events, around 5000 events per second, and can be viewed as
either a directed or undirected graph. It could be used for the streaming EDA and streaming
expiring graphs topics as well as feature extraction for payphones for the beyond supervised
learning topic.

In general we have better collection of calls where the two sides are in different countries,
although for some countries we also have good collection of in-country calls. This means the
graph can have some unusual features and it is worth bearing these in mind when examining
features of the graph. Some properties of SIGINT collected telephony graphs are discussed in
[I33, I34]. A comparison between SIGINT collected call records and billing records is given in

[I73].	_________________

On SUN STORM the data can be found under	in folders named by

date. The full format is as described in the Interface Control Document [I79] but with an
additional field at the end which uniquely identifies the event within SUN STORM.

In DISTILLERY the data is forwarded into the shared SPL instance on the BHDIST cluster
by running a VlTCPSource in client mode. The resulting stream can be subscribed to using
the subscription DataFeed=="Salamanca" && EventType=="FullCallRecord".

The full data contains many attributes, but the relevant ones are the timestamp and
callLength along with identifiers. Records will typically have some of dialledNumber, di-
alledNumberNorm, callerID and callerIDNorm, where the “Norm” versions may have been
normalised, for example by adding the country code. The normalised versions are in E.164
format and give the fully qualified number as opposed to the digits actually dialled which could
include just the local number.

Some identifiers are specific to mobile telephony, including the IMSI (which is an ID for a
SIM card), the IMEI (which is an ID for a mobile phone handset), and the MSISDN (which
should match one of dialledNumberNorm and callerIDNorm). To know which side of the call
these attributes refer to you must also read the CallDirection attribute which is either “MO”
for mobile originated (i.e. the IMSI and IMEI relate to the callerID) or “MT” for mobile
terminated (i.e. the IMSI and IMEI relate to the dialledNumber).

Time

Figure 6: Plot of events counts per hour in our snapshot of FIVE ALIVE data. The period from
May 6-11 is clearly the best quality.

F.1.2 FIVE ALIVE

FIVE ALIVE is an ICTR prototype Query Focused Dataset (QFD) providing access to bulk
IP-IP connection events, giving a unique unselected view of all activity on SIGINT bearers.
Each record in FIVE ALIVE summarises a flow between two IP addresses. This summary
consists of:

•	The start of flow time, unfortunately at second granularity in the static dataset, but
microsecond granularity in DISTILLERY.

•	The source and destination IPs and ports and the protocol—together these are known as
the 5-tuple, hence the name FIVE ALIVE.

•	Optionally extra information on flow size and direction depending upon the protocol.
The data format is fully described in [I9].

We have a snapshot of FIVE ALIVE data covering, with gaps, approximately 6-19 May
2011. Figure 6 shows the number of events per hour in this snapshot. This snapshot is available:

•	On the GOLD MINE Hadoop cluster at	in hdfs. The

dates on the subdirectories indicate when it was loaded into the cluster and should be
ignored.

•	On Mount McKinley at

There is also a feed of streaming FIVE ALIVE data on the BHDIST DISTILLERY
cluster. It is a high-rate feed (around 1 million events a second) and is published in
multiple “Splits”. They can be imported in the shared instance using the subscrip-
tion DataFeed == "FiveAlive" && EventType == "FlowRecord" && Split == "N" where
N ranges from 0 to 11 (but this may be increased to accommodate additional bearers). Don’t
leave out the Split condition or you’ll get all the data in one feed. Ideally you should run your
initial processing on the same host as the data is published to reduce network load. This data
could also be made available at Bude to provide a multi-site high-rate feed.

F.1.3 HRMap

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP2 CHORDAL.

When a user requests a webpage from the internet, this is observed in SIGINT as an HTTP
GET request. As well as the page requested it often contains the URL of the previously viewed
page. The hostname of the requested page is the “HOST” and the hostname of the previous
page is the “REFERRER”. When we consider just the hostnames rather than the full URI
then this is considered events data. This can be viewed as a directed graph of hostnames, and
is given the name HRMap at GCHQ. It is a moderately high rate stream (around 20000 events
per second) which should be suitable for the streaming EDA and streaming expiring graphs
topics.

Since many web pages point to other web pages on the same server, a large proportion of
HRMap events have the hostname matching the referrer. Many records will have no referrer.
This happens if the user typed the URL, uses a bookmark, or has configured their browser not
to send the referrer attribute.

As well as the host and referrer, an HRMap record also contains a timestamp (in seconds),
the client IP address, the client port, and the client HTTP header fingerprint (HHFP) which
is a hash of various headers sent by the client and can be used to approximately distinguish
clients behind a gateway [I38].

HRMap data is available in DISTILLERY on the bhdist cluster.
It can be imported in the shared instance using the subscription
DataFeed == "HRMap" && EventType == "HostReferrer". HRMap could also be made
available at Bude to give a multi-site streaming graph

Static HRMap is available on the SUN STORM Hadoop cluster at
and	Now that the HAGEL AWEL Hadoop cluster at Bude is

operational, data collected there will no longer be loaded onto SUN STORM. Data collected
at Bude now instead is loaded onto HAGER AWEL at	The Bude data

at Cheltenham will gradually age off and be deleted 6 months after its load date.

F.1.4 SKB

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP2 CHORDAL UKEO.

The Signature Knowledge Base is a system for tracking file transfers made on the internet. A
record is made each time we see certain file types being transferred. Each file is identified by
its format and a hash of some of its content. Whilst this does mean we can store the data,
hash collisions are inevitable. Therefore one cannot guarantee that all records referring to the
same hash are in fact the same file. Further we only process a small number of different file
formats. The dictionary of which file types are logged is given in [I86].

Each single line record in the SKB dataset has the format:

date time src_IP dst_IP frag_# IP_ID len protocol.# src_port dst_port seq_#
ack_# file_offset file_type file_signature src_geo dst_geo

The SKB data is stored both in a QFD for analysts to query and in BLACKHOLE. We
have an extract of 1 week on SKB data	If you require more data

then it is possible to extract some using the blacktools interface.

F.1.5 Arrival Processes

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP 2.

There are two standard datasets that have been used to evaluate all approaches to temporal
correlation. These are known as the telephony and C2C datasets. They both consist of records
of stochastic processes in the format

<name>\t<Number of events>\t<Space separated event times>

and files containing pairs of identifiers to be scored in the format

<name1> <name2>

The data is stored in /data/himr_dm/data/arrival_processes.

Telephony data

The original event times were taken from 18 weeks worth of telephony data. These event times
were then transformed to give the times in the .sps files.

Random pairs of event times are generated this way: choose a pair of distinct originating
numbers, A and B; choose from the set {1,..., 17}; circularly shift the event times of B by 5
weeks (i.e. modify the event times of B by adding 5 x 604800 to them modulo T = 18 x 604800,
604800 being the number of seconds in a week). The purpose of the cyclic shift is to reduce the
effect of any “random” pairs in which some of A’s calls truly cause B to make calls. Shifting
by one-week multiples is done to retain the time-of-day and day-of-week structure of the data.
If time interval [0, T) can be partitioned into two subintervals, one containing all of the events
of A and the other containing all of the events of B, then (A, B) is rejected as a random
pair for experimental purposes since presumably no one would consider that they might be
correlated. The stochastic processes generated in this way are in the file^^^^^^^^s. This
file contains 151,811 processes. B’s name has 5 appended to show the size of the shift. For
example if 441242221491 had been shifted 3 weeks it would be called 441242221491.03.

Causal pairs of event times are generated this way: generate a random pair (A, B); randomly
select proportion p of A’s call initiation times; to each selected initiation time, add the duration
of the corresponding call plus a delay drawn from an exponential distribution with mean f
seconds; merge the resulting times into B’s call initiation times. A proportion of A’s calls
cause B to make a call, and B makes these calls after the causative call of A ends and after a

one used in experiments is	s. This file contains 155,746 processes. B’s

name has 5 and A’s name appended. For example if 441242221491 had been shifted 3 weeks and
had a causal dependency on 441242226816 it would be called 441242221491.03.441242226816.
Both the random and causal pairs for CLASP to score are listed in the file

C2C data

The event times were taken from 93 days of C2C presence activity. Records are logged each time
the identifier is seen performing an activity. The timestamps in the C2C data are unaltered to
provide a realistic test dataset. The stochastic processes are in the file ip.all.sps.new.sun2.
There are 457,305 processes in this file.

There are also two pairs files. The file	contains 431,689 random pairs.

The file	contains 45,932 pairs in which the proportion of causal pairs was

thought by the data experts to be relatively high, compared to the proportion of causal pairs
in the set of all identifier pairs. The exact criteria for making it onto these lists can be found
in section 2.4 of [I49]. The names of identifiers consist of the username, a series of dots and
dashes and then the identifier type. There are no transformations done to the names in the
C2C data.

F.1.6 SOLID INK and FLUID INK

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP1.

These are quite old telephony datasets, but we feel it is worth highlighting them to HIMR
researchers because the view they offer is so unusual.

SOLID INK is three weeks of telephony events from 2007, as seen from billing records.
FLUID INK is an approximate subset of SOLID INK, but as seen via GCHQ’s SIGINT collec-
tion. Our points of access mean that we mostly collect calls between the target country and the
rest of the world; therefore in-country calls are likely to be missing from FLUID INK. Indeed,
SOLID INK has 2.7 billion events involving 74 million numbers, while FLUID INK has only
136 million events involving 15 million numbers.

There are also various sources of SIGINT noise which are poorly understood, such as missing
calls, duplicate calls, node mislabelling and timing errors. We only have anonymized versions
of the datasets available: for legal reasons, we could not retain the unminimized versions this
long.

Each INK data set has four fields: timestamp, user-1, user-2 and a number. Unfortunately,
the timestamp fields seem to have become corrupted somewhere along the line, and in different
ways in each of the datasets. However, timestamp deltas within each set are probably still
correct (in seconds). In FLUID INK the call direction is user-1 to user-2, and the fourth field

is call duration in seconds. In SOLID INK the fourth field is a code in {1, 2, 3, 4}, where:

1	= Voice user-1 to user-2

2	= SMS user-1 to user-2

3	= Voice user-2 to user-1

4	= SMS user-2 to user-1

The datasets are available at	and

There are also

versions, where events involving pizza nodes have been removed.

A very interesting analysis of these datasets came out of the 2008 graph mining SWAMP at
HIMR [I73], which revealed just how great the disparity between SIGINT and ‘ground truth’
can be, for example when it comes to contact chaining. CSEC have also done some work that
largely confirms and replicates those results [W4].

F.1.7 Squeal hits

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP2 CHORDAL UKEO.

Squeal is a signature-based system for detecting electronic attacks, see [W39]. When a poten-
tial attack is detected a hit is forwarded to DISTILLERY. Each hit contains the source and
destination IPs and ports, the timestamp, the hit details and geolocation for the IP addresses.
By examining multiple hits we may be able to learn about the attacks. For example, we might
look for multiple IP addresses that launch attacks in a similar way.

A stream of Squeal hits is initially created on the AHS Explore DISTILLERY cluster,
however this is also forwarded to the shared SPL instance on the BHDIST cluster. It can be
imported using the subscription DataFeed=="Squeal" && EventType=="SquealHit". This is
a low rate stream, around 75 events per second, and contains the hits from all sites.

Squeal hits are available on the SUN STORM Hadoop cluster at /data/ead. This covers
events collected from all sites.

F.2 Open-source graphs and events

We also provide some open-source graphical and events based data which may be of specific
relevance to this research.

F.2.1 Enron

The contents of this dataset are classified UNCLASSIFIED.

Enron was an American energy company that collapsed in 2001 due to massive financial fraud
and eventual bankruptcy. After criminal proceedings were completed the complete emails of
around 150 Enron employees, mostly senior management, were publicly released. There are
approximately half a million emails covering November 1998 to July 2002. There is a brief
introduction to this dataset in [E22]. This gives a few summary statistics, such as number
of emails per user and conversation thread length. We have a copy of enron.sql, the SQL

database file which contains this data. The format of this is not particularly nice so we have
also extracted a simpler data set, which hopefully contains the data needed for this work. If
not it is not too hard to return to the original file to gather more data. This formatted file is
called enron_transactions.txt. Each email has one record for each recipient, however each
line contains all relevant information. Each record is tab separated with the following fields

<time> <timezone> <message_id> <sender> <recipient> <recipient_type> <subject>

F.2.2 US flights data

The contents of this dataset are classified UNCLASSIFIED.

The American Statistical Association’s Data Expo ’09 asked for analysis of a large dataset
of US flight arrivals and departures. The data was made available to the public by the
US Department of Transport’s research arm, RITA (Research and Innovative Technology
Administration), and covers the years 1987 to 2008. The Expo ’09 website is mirrored at

It con-
tains a fuller description of the problem, as well as the winning posters produced by participants
in the competition.

When the Home Office decided to fund UKVAC research (see section 5.8.2), it was decided
to provide the researchers with two unclassified challenge problems in order to focus their
efforts. One was chosen by the HUMINT agencies: to predict the next winners of Nobel prizes.
The second came from GCHQ, and was to do further analysis on the RITA flights data. In
fact, the second author of this problem book was largely responsible for selecting the problem
and framing its statement, so it mirrors very closely the point of view of this problem book,
particularly section 5. The flights are meant to be an unclassified proxy for SIGINT events
data, and although the dataset can just about be handled in core on modern hardware, UKVAC
participants were strongly encouraged to process the data in a stream.

We hope that researchers will be able to compare their approaches, especially on visual-
ization questions, with what the UKVAC comes up with: having a common dataset should
help with that. In case any direct collaboration emerges with UKVAC participants, having the
dataset they are working on to hand will obviously also be a significant help.

The data consists of 22 bzipped CSV files, one for each year. Each record has 29 fields,
described in table 4. Supplemental CSV files describe the codes used for airports, carriers and
some individual planes: see the	page on the Expo ’09 mirror.

F.2.3 Wikipedia graph

The contents of this dataset are classified UNCLASSIFIED.

This is not directly relevant for SIGINT, but there are several reasons why it might be handy
to have around. Many outside algorithms get tested on this graph, so it might be useful for
benchmarking, or as test data to apply algorithms intended for external publication to. It is
also a foil for HR map (appendix F.1.3): although that data set does not contain internal clicks
between Wikipedia pages (so there is no direct comparison), nonetheless it might be interesting

the .title file).

F.3 SIGINT reference data

To help researchers enrich their research findings we provide lists of websites of interest and
target selectors. We also provide lists of covert infrastructure and known payphones to support
research on information flow in graphs and positive-only learning.

F.3.1 Websites of interest

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP2 UKEO.

A list of websites of interest is available in a database on	. These

have been manually classified through open source research and contain radical and extremist
sites along with many others. These may be useful when examining HRMap data to determine
target density.

To get a list of radical and extremist sites, first get a username and password from Andrew
Ross (ajrossl). Then connect to the database and run the query as follows:

~db2user/sqllib/bin/db2 connect to DIST1

~db2user/sqllib/bin/db2 "select SITENAME, RADICALISM, Type, URL
from

where RADICALISM = ’Radical’ or RADICALISM = ’Extremist’"

~db2user/sqllib/bin/db2 connect reset

It is also possible to use this data directly in DISTILLERY using the Database toolkit.
F.3.2 Target selectors

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP2 UKEO.

Our target knowledge database is BROAD OAK which includes the ability to task various
selector types including phone numbers and email addresses. The resulting list of selectors is
sometimes called the target dictionary and is delivered to our DISTILLERY clusters at least
once a day, and is also available on our Hadoop clusters. This data could be used to see if some
result set contains an increased density of targets.

For DISTILLERY, the telephony and C2C dictionaries are delivered in separate streams
and can be imported with DataFeed=="BroadOak" && EventType=="TargetSelector" and
DataFeed=="BroadOakC2C" && EventType=="TargetSelector" respectively. A re-send of the
latest dictionary can be requested by sending a UDP packet to

(port 10450 for telephony, 10460 for C2C) containing the line resend. This could be sent with
a UDPSink operator.

On SUN STORM, the BROAD OAK reference data (all target types) is in HDFS at

When using selectors to examine parts of a graph then this is considered targetting and an
HRA log must be completed. See appendix E on page 67 for details.

F.3.3 Covert Infrastructure

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP1.

GCHQ has knowledge of, and collection from, CNE acceses owned by foreign intelligence
agencies. This is done without their permission and is known as fourth party collec-
tion. As data is exfiltrated from target networks we should be able to see information
flows over their infrastructure. Data on foreign covert infrastructure can be found at

We also have knowledge of our own covert infrastructure. However this data is understand-
ably more sensitive. Work is still ongoing to explore the possibility of making this dataset
accessible to HIMR researchers.

F.3.4 Conficker botnet

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP1.

GCHQ has an interest in being able to detect botnets operating in the wild. This is cur-
rently done using packet content fingerprinting and specific behaviours of certain bot software.
However we would like to be able to detect botnets only by their generalisable activity. For
the Conficker botnet we have a list of IP addresses that hit against either the packet fin-
gerprinting or a Conficker specific activity profile. The fingerprinted IPs can be found at

This set should be largely reliable as
the signature is believed to be highly discriminative. The behaviourally identified IPs are at

These are slightly more tentative and
are based on the Conficker software contacting remote IPs on specific ports. Of course this can
happen randomly so only those IPs which perform a significantly high number, after Bonferoni
correction, make the list. As Conficker contains a peer-to-peer (P2P) component we believe
that there may be information flows involving these potentially infected IPs.

F.3.5 Payphones

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP1.

Analysts are interested in understanding telephone numbers in their analysis. A particular
feature of a number they would like to know is whether the number is a payphone. The fact
that a number is a payphone would suggest that contact chaining through the number is not
recommended. On the other hand some target discovery work starts with a known modus op-
erandi of payphone usage (which targets follow to make it hard to target their communication)
and so looking for communication between payphones is the starting point.

However GCHQ have lists of payphones for very few countries. The aim is start from partial
lists of payphones in some countries and extend to full lists of payphones in those countries

has provided lists of payphones in four countries as described in

table 5.

GCHQ have recently moved their telephony event data to the cloud and we do not have
feature extraction algorithms for this data. However the basic features in [I3] should be easy to
implement from scratch as an Hadoop analytic using the data as described in appendix F.1.1.

We also provide the source code for the original SPIKY ROCK feature extraction as C code.

The use of payphones is an active interest so a complete Hadoop feature extraction and ◄
classification analytic would be likely to be directly taken on by GCHQ and results fed into
the the LUCKY STRIKE database.

The data and the old SPIKY ROCK source code is available in

F.4 SIGINT truthed data

To support the beyond supervised learning research we provide several SIGINT truthed datasets
from recent research.

F.4.1 Logo recognition

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP1.

We are interested in automatically detecting the source of videos on the internet through the
recognition of logos in the video. We have previously researched logo detection and have recently
looked at supervised machine learning for logo recognition [I19].	has

provided the data from this research.

The feature space is derived as follows:

1.	Logo detection algorithms give us the logo and mask (i.e. the logo shape) as 8-bit images.
The mask is binary in that values are either 0 or 255 (i.e. black or white).

2.	Both the logo and mask are independently downscaled to 8 x 8. During these down-
sampling processes the results are rescaled so that they retain their original pixel depth
(i.e. 8-bit).

3.	These 2 resulting 8-bit images are pointwise multiplied to give a 16-bit image (with a
range of 0-65535).

Sam is happy to look at extracting other features if HIMR actively research this dataset.

We provide 530 truthed samples. The data has been truthed to 109 classes. 7 classes have
more than 20 examples, 67 classes have only 1 example.

from ICTR-MCA is happy to work with JTRIG to try and provide larger
untruthed datasets if the researchers decide to work on this problem.

The data is available	The first field “Class” is

a numeric representation of the class and the remaining fields are the features.

F.4.2 Spam detection

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP1.

Spam emails are a large proportion of emails seen in SIGINT. GCHQ would like to reduce the
impact of spam emails on data storage, processing and analysis. Most external spam detectors
work by analysing the content of an email however policy and processing mean this option is
not always open to us. We must work on features derived from events alone. We therefore
lower our target and instead aim to classify email addresses by the type of emails they send.

has provided datasets from his team’s research into this prob-
lem. They built a classifier called MYOFIBRIL [I44]. The dataset consists of an 1809 example
email addresses with 143 features each truthed into 11 classes. Note that one class is “mul-
tiple_classes” and one class is “uncertain”.

This data set is provided in	This directory also contains a

PDF documenting the dataset in more detail [I43].

It would be possible to use the data	on SUN STORM (reading

these files with SILVER LIBRARY is recommended) to generate untruthed feature vectors.
However it should be noted that the collection posture of GCHQ has changed considerably
since the truth data was collected.

F.4.3 Protocol classification

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP1.

GCHQ is interested in understanding C2C traffic on bearers. One approach is to use signa-
tures of known applications but signatures can not cover all traffic. We therefore look at the
alternative approach of classifying traffic based on its behaviour. Such approaches may also
provide a way to understand traffic in encrypted tunnels.

We provide datasets from 7 different bearers provided by	[I54]

and used in [I70] (see [W1] for related research). Each bearer’s data consists of a little over
100,000 example TCP flows with 51 features truthed to 15 broad classes (and 39 detailed
classes). These classifications have been obtained by binary content signatures. Note that one
class is “NULL” which indicates that no signature hit on that flow.

These datasets allow one to check the robustness of a classifier against concept drift both
in time (the data spans a little over a year [I70]) and across bearers.

The data is provided at	Note each bearer’s data is arbit-

rarily split into training and test sets but this split need not be preserved.

F.4.4 Steganography detection

The contents of this dataset are classified TOP SECRET STRAP1.

Some targets try to hide their communications through the use of steganography. One approach
is to slightly alter the coefficients in a JPEG image to encode the hidden data whilst trying to
minimise visual changes in the JPEG. We would like a classifier that can identify such altered
images (commonly called stegged images).

has provided data used to build Random Forest classifiers [I74].
There are a few interesting features of this dataset:

•	This problem can be viewed either as a classification or a regression problem. One can
either regress on the density of embedded data or classify whether there is any embedded
data or not.

•	The truthing process simulated embedding data into a large sample of images. Some of
these images might have started with steganography in them and so the truthing may
not be accurate.

•	This dataset has the most truthed examples. The original research had 50,000 clean
and 50,000 stegged images (for each of 4 steg types) for training and 500,000 clean and
200,000 stegged images (per steg type) for validation and testing. The reason for such a
large test and validation set is that we want to ensure a very low false positive rate.

• There are the most features of the truthed datasets. There are 661 features (introduced
in [I74]). Features are computed in classes and so could be used to experiment with
cost-sensitive feature selection.

Data is available at	as compressed CSV files. The first two

fields should be ignored and the final field of the stegged files contains the simulated stegging
rate. The rest of the fields are the features (summarised in [I74]).

F.4.5 Genre classification

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP1.

A way to make analysts more efficient and also allow further analytics is to add labels to textual
content to describe the genre of the content.	has provided text

data sets classified into genres along with the AURA feature extractor [I83].

AURA extracts 108 features from text documents as described in [I85, I84]. Some features
are from basic counts, some are based on email headers and some are based on more advanced
textual analysis. AURA can be run on a text document with:

java -jar aura.jar <text_file> | head -108

The first 108 lines of AURA’s output are the feature values. Other information about the file
is returned in the remaining lines.

We would like to label webpages by the type of information on the page. In this case we want to
identify pages that contain information on chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN)
weapons.	has previously researched this as a supervised learning

problem [I36] and has provided his data from this research.

Webpages have been labelled by an analyst into four classes: CW (chemical weapons), BW
(biological weapons), RN (radiological/nuclear) and NI (not interesting).

Data is provided at	in the “arff” format used by Weka.

This format can be treated as a CSV file after removing the header lines.

The most important file is	. This file is the full dataset

used to produce the original classifier. It contains vectors for all documents in the CBRN
dataset, where each feature corresponds to a single word, and the value of each feature is the
number of instances of the word in the document divided by total number of words in the
document.

also produced lists of the most prevalent words across each topic (in the folder as
Bvector, Cvector, Rvector, Nvector and RNvector), and then developed a dataset where each
feature was a count of words from each list found in the document (the two

files).	reports that these features did not produce very good results compared to

individual words, so the dataset wasn’t refined much further, but you may find it interesting.

If required the original HTML pages and classifications may be available but could not be
easily found at the time of writing the problem book.

F.5 Fusion of scores data

The contents of this dataset are classified SECRET STRAP2 CHORDAL UKEO.

The fusion of scores problem can occur in several contexts. In the following we describe the
creation of IP geolocation reference data.

We want to know the geolocation of IP addresses for many analytic processes. In the main,
there are two types of data we use:

Commercial Various commercial providers provide estimates for IP address locations. ICTR-
NE have provided Akamai’s Edgescape dataset.

SIGINT We find that commercial providers sometimes give poor locations in areas of the
world of SIGINT interest. We therefore need to augment the commercial data and choose
to do this through analysis of locations referenced in IP collection (e.g. in user profiles
or web forms). We hope that these locations give evidence towards the location of the

users of that IP address. See [I69] for the scoring approach currently used. ICTR-NE
have provided data from five different types of IP data (called INJUNCTION, PSYCHIC
SALMON, RAGING BULLFROG, ROBOTIC FISH and TIMID TOAD).

The aim is to use these different sources to come up with the best estimate of an IP address’s
location. For simplicity we recommend considering geolocation to country-level only.

The Edgescape data comes as five gzipped text files; each file covers a different range of
IP address space. Each line describes a subnet (an IP address or IP address range). The first
field gives the IP address range as a subnet and a subnet mask. The second field contains
information about the subnet as key-value pairs. In particular the “country_code” field is their
guess of the country and the first letter of the “confidence” field gives the confidence in their
estimate. Confidences are either high “H”, medium “M” or low “L”.

Each SIGINT system dataset also comes as a gzipped text file with each line describing a
subnet. The full format is described in [I66] but we describe the important features here. The
first field is the subnet and the second field the subnet mask (typically 24). The last field is
a semi-colon separated field where the penultimate field is the country and the last character
of the last field is the confidence. Confidences are either high “H”, medium “M” or low “L”.
These confidences should not be treated as being on the same scale as Edgescape but should
be comparable between the five SIGINT systems.

The files can be found at
