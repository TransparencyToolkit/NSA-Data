Iraq interrogation reports now available (S//REL)
(S//REL) Do you need the ability to quickly search Iraq interrogation reporting for personalities,
aliases or cover terms used by Anti-Coalition Forces? Do the 76 cover terms used for Internet
communication by Ibrahim Abdul Karim Telakoi (aka Omar Baziyani plus his other 5 alias
names) interest you?
(S//REL) Did you know that one source recently reported his methods for staying in contact via
cell phones during strikes on US forces? Do you need the false names used by Al-Qaida
leadership or the Mujahadeen chief in Samawa's mobile phone number?
(S//REL) If this data is vital in your SIGINT Development activities, then you need to request
access to the newly established PATHFINDER Data Set TIRs_IQ* [Tactical Interrogation Reports
-- Iraq]. Currently, there are over 7,000 reports in this data set (from May 2004 to present) and
more added weekly (from the SIGINT Development Leads Developer in Baghdad). To establish a
PATHFINDER account, please follow the instructions at:
(Content Source Documents: SIR-1CD-312-DIF-05-0091-D0331 / SIR-1CD-312-DIF-04-1185D0234 / SIR-1CD-312-DIF-05-0015-D0331)
