(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce
another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe
these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are
interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(C) This month's featured speaker is
 from the TAC's Social Network
Analysis Workcenter. Below is a brief description of her planned presentation:
(C//SI) Many of you have heard about SNA and have probably wondered, "So what is so
new about SNA? I'm already doing my own personal social network analysis!" In
response to the rising awareness in what we've accomplished over the past three years,
we in the Social Network Analysis Workcenter (S2S2) would like to invite you to learn
more about our strategies for incorporating and sustaining support for SNA integrated
within your daily analytic processes. We see SNA as a complement to our more
traditional analysis of target communications externals, in that it seeks to understand
how the target personalities are connected and work with one another. As a counterpart
to well-developed externals analysis methodologies, we realized the power that SNA
could have for SIGINT if we could establish the same disciplined approach for
consolidating our content-based knowledge through SNA principles.
(C//SI) Thanks to the efforts of you and many of your peers, we in the SNAW have
learned much about your analytic needs for a consistent, standardized SNA methodology
and the tools and automation required to support it. As a result, we would like to take
this opportunity to describe our "SNA for SIGINT" methodology, illustrate some recent
analytic successes, and update you on our progress towards developing ASSIMILATOR,
our Advanced Technology Demonstration tool. Please come prepared with your questions
and ideas, as we are dedicated to building "SNA for SIGINT" that will ultimately provide
another technique for you, the analyst, to KNOW IT!
(U//FOUO) To register for one of these sessions , Military and Civilian employees can call
