The<br>new PTC will act as the sister organization to the highly successful European Technical Center<br>(ETC), providing essential technical and logistical services to vital cryptologic missions in the<br>Pacific Theater.<br>(S//SI) Since its establishment in 1959, NCRJ has supported the NSA SIGINT mission by<br>providing operational and technical assistance primarily to its Japanese Third Party partner and<br>US military components in Japan. It also assists other Pacific Theater partners at the request of<br>the respective NSA/CSS Representatives and US military components outside of Japan. This<br>latter technical support has been ad hoc in nature and--excluding internal support to NCRJ itself-has grown to the point that it is on the same level or even surpasses the level of technical<br>support provided internal to Japan. The PTC, an office of NCRJ, provides the technical support<br>mentioned above. Besides supporting new initiatives, the PTC supports critical capabilities for:<br>Global War on Terrorism, Homeland Defense, PRC/NKOR military comms, crime &amp; narcotics, etc.<br>(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Director recently tasked Chief, NCRJ to identify what would be required<br>for the PTC to operate in the Pacific Theater the way the ETC operates in the European Theater.<br>While the NCRJ technical support division has provided these services for many years, SID<br>leadership has decided that world events and new strategic thrusts warrant a new infusion of<br>money and manpower to support this all-important mission. With new uncertainties on the<br>Korean peninsula, continued high interest in the PRC, new endeavors in SIGINT Development<br>and a terrorist trail leading more and more into east Asia, it is crucial that the US Cryptologic<br>System (USCS) remain healthy and poised to prosecute these Pacific Theater missions. Billets<br>now being advertised represent the additional manpower to augment NCRJ in its early evolution<br>of the PTC. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new Pacific support concept;<br>a chance to make a real contribution to the mission of the USCS in the Pacific.<br>(U//FOUO) The PTC currently has several vacancies for talented technical professionals in<br>SIGINT Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, and Computer Science. These vacancies<br>are advertised in the Field Vacancy book published on 11 July. Additionally, NCRJ has vacancies<br>for Intelligence/Network Analysts, Signals Analysts and SIGINT Liaison Officers at Misawa,<br>Tokyo, Yokota and Okinawa . This is an ideal opportunity for individuals who are good at solving<br>technical and analytical problems and who are interested in keeping the mission afloat to step<br>forward and be counted.<br>(U//FOUO) For individuals interested in traveling, Japan offers a great jumping off point to Asia<br>and the South Pacific. Take the plunge, help shape the new PTC, provide hands-on support to<br>critical missions and see the Far East and Pacific!<br>(U//FOUO) Note: See related article in NSA Daily for additional info about the PTC.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
