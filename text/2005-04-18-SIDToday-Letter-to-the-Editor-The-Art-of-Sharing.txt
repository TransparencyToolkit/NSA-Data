(U) We received a letter on the recent article The Art of Sharing: Insight and Continuity :
From: CPT 

 

Comment: (U//FOUO) The issue of continuity is one that has kept with me throughout my 20
years in the military, and having worked under BG Defreitas in the USFK C/J2 in Korea, and to
hear his thoughts here in the Iraq Theater of Operations is to hear an echo of my own concerns.
We as a military (and I use that to cover the ancillary support organizations), do a poor job of
capturing the not just the lessons learned (which has become overused), but the processes
learned. Processes, whether they be communication, architecture, connectivity, points of
contact, are the first things to drop when the "Relief in Place" drives out of the Forward
Operating Base. All of those processes lead to the way we THINK about the problem, which leads
to the sort of insight mentioned in the article. The military juggernaut (Army), is riding a
tsunami of information overload, and we have not built the proper life preserver to wrap our
arms around it.
