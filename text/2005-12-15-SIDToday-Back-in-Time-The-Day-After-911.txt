(U) The day after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Sir Francis Richards, then Director of
GCHQ, sent the following note to DIRNSA:
Mike - There is nothing I can say that does justice to the horror of yesterday's events, or to the
evil that devised them. All our thoughts and prayers are with you and the people of America. You
know that whatever we have is at your disposal.
God bless 
Francis
