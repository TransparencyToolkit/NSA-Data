(U) President Bush has set an ambitious U.S. policy goal of introducing and spreading democracy
throughout the Middle East. The groundwork for regional states to move forward is set in
political and economic reform of corrupt governments and bankrupt systems. What are the
prospects for a successful transition among cultures, peoples and states where traditional values
are often at odds with good governance, accountability, and personal freedom? We will look at
the challenges, including the aims and efforts of other major powers external to the region.
