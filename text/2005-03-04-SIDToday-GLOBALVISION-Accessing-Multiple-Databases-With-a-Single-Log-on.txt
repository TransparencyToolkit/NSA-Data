(C) GLOBALVISION: Accessing Multiple Databases With a Single Logon
FROM: Gregory L. Wessel
Technical Director for SIGINT Development (SSG)
Run Date: 03/04/2005

New federated query capability for analytic databases released this week (C)
(C) On February 28, Analysis & Production (S2) released the first GLOBALVISION analytic tool: a
single sign-on federated query capability. With this release, users will be able to access the
following databases from a single pull-down menu: ASSOCIATION, FASCIA, CONTRAOCTAVE,
DISHFIRE, HOMEBASE, MAINWAY, OCTAVE, PINWALE, SPOTBEAM, SPEEDBUMP and
YACHTSHOP. GLOBALVISION has selected MAINWAY's Sigint Navigator as the vehicle for
delivery of this single sign-on federated query capability. The new version (4.0) of SigNav
provides access to many of the databases and tools analysts need to do their jobs from a single
desktop application, with a single log-on. The good news is if you already have a SigNav or
GLOBALREACH account, you automatically have a GLOBALVISION account.
(S//SI) This GLOBALVISION/SigNav release also contains a number of new features that simplify
access to other tools. For example, while contact-chaining in GLOBALVISION/SigNav, analysts
will be alerted to the availability of some forms of content and will be able to view that content
using the CREST and UIS tools with a couple of mouse-clicks, if you already have an account
with those data marts. Also, contact-chaining results in GLOBALVISION/SigNav can now be
easily viewed using Analyst Notebook. The goal is to allow analysts to spend more time analyzing
the data and less time wrestling with the tools. This release of GLOBALVISION/SigNav is a big
step in that direction.
(S) For more information on these new features, and for details on how to get an account, see
the GLOBALVISION or MAINWAY webpage ("go GLOBALVISION" or "go mainway"). Training and
Demos can be scheduled by clicking on the training calendar link on the MAINWAY webpage.
Feedback is welcome and can be sent to mailto
.
Background:
(S) The GLOBALVISION partnership is facilitating the integration of legacy user interfaces and
data marts. The partnership is capitalizing on the software development capabilities of Target
Development Services along with the MAINWAY and HOMEBASE programs to enhance analysts'
abilities to access the right data with the right tools. One of the first accomplishments of this
partnership is the deployment of the single sign-on federated query capability. GLOBALVISION
represents the "righthand side" of the APATS strategy and has three spirals scheduled for
release through July 2005, defined in the Requirements Document dated January 18, 2005.
