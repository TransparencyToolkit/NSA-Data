Analyze MG Quirk's engagement strategy for stakeholders<br>and partners - and, if appropriate, tell him what you think<br>won't work.<br>2.  Assist SID senior leadership in institutionalizing SIGINT<br>business processes<br>3.  Prepare a speech for the SID Deputy Director to present to<br>a U.S. Ambassadors' Seminar.<br>4.  Take notes at an offsite.<br>5.  Transport MG Quirk's white board in your truck to the<br>offsite.<br>6.  Represent SID at a prep session with General Hayden.<br>7.  All of the above<br>(U//FOUO) Obviously the answer is 7 - all of the above - plus a<br>whole lot more. The depth and breadth of activities for members of<br>the SIGINT Action Team are as varied as the backgrounds and skill<br>levels of the members of the team.<br>(U//FOUO) The perception of most outsiders, upon finding out that<br>you work on the Action Team, is one of "oh wow you must be<br>really busy", or "ugh," or more often than not, "what's that?"<br>However, those who have been on the team know that the<br>experience can be invigorating and the environment one of the<br>best for learning. It's not all rosy - there are periods where it is<br>thankless, tiring, late days, frustrating - but it's never boring.<br>(U//FOUO) On a daily basis, the members of the team (generally<br>consisting of 6-7 people) provide a variety of services to MG Quirk,<br>Charlie Meals, the Chief of Staff, and the SID Deputy Directors<br>(i.e., bubbles). Members of the team are intimately involved with<br>SID leadership activities that lead the way for change for SID applying strategic thinking, vision, creativity and innovation to a<br>multitude of tasks. The lower end of the experience is the<br>mundane - such as running to the repro machine to make copies of<br>a briefing at 6:00 PM on a Friday night before a long holiday<br>weekend. The higher end is having the respect and gratitude of<br>SID senior leadership - not just for the tasks completed, but also<br>for the experience and analytic value we bring to the table.<br>(U//FOUO) Although the team often operates in a QRC mode, there<br>is a semblance of order. Each day brings change, but it's generally<br>manageable. The key to survival is real teamwork, flexibility, and<br>the ability to handle the mundane to the intricate all at the same<br>time. (Having a truck could also prove useful. Having a sense of<br>humor is absolutely essential.)<br>(U//FOUO) The Team is housed in a nondescript little room at the<br>foot of the escalators in OPS1 - save for the little sign on the door,<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) A Day in the Life of...<br>1.
