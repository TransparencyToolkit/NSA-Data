(U) Letter to the Editor : Too Much Redundancy is Redundant

(U) Here's a comment on the article Too Much Redundancy is Redundant :
(U//FOUO) From : 
(U) Comment : The redundancies illustrated in the first paragraph of the article are indeed
proliferating. Not only do I see them in print, I hear them spoken on the street; and what's more
disturbing, I see them in printed mass media such as the newspaper and spoken on television. It
all reminds me very much of a book I read several years ago by a journalist named Edwin
Newman called "Strictly Speaking." Mr Newman addressed redundancies, as well as a host of
other crimes against the English language characterized by the non-word "irregardless." And
speaking of redundancies, let's not forget some of the classics, such as "basic fundamentals,"
"true facts," "each and every," "one and only," "close proximity," "general consensus of
opinion," and one of my personal favorites, "flashes of consistency."
