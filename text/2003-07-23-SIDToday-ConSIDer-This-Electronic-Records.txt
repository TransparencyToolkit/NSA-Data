Now<br>that much of our information is stored on computers, how do we<br>store it? At this time, there is no central electronic archive for the<br>Agency. Some records are printed out and retired to the Records<br>Center; others are migrated to other media for eventual transfer to<br>the NSA/CSS Archives.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA's Records Management experts report that though<br>there are a few special considerations to keep in mind when dealing<br>with electronic records, the same basic rules apply as to any other<br>medium. First, determine if the information is truly a record. The<br>Agency's four Records Disposition Schedules can help with this, as<br>well as guide you in the length of time those records need to be<br>legally maintained. With long-term or permanent electronic<br>records, you must keep in mind that the hardware and software<br>most likely will be outdated in a relatively short time and plans<br>should be in place to allow future access to the information, such<br>as migration to the new system or to other media.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) ConSIDer This:<br>1.

If you have the only copy of a<br>record, you may want to have a central directory for your office, or<br>be sure to arrange transfer of your records if you leave that<br>organization. Delete short-term and non-records regularly to avoid<br>burying your valuable information and wasting a great deal of time<br>in searching and re-creating records. Also be sure to include<br>related information (metadata) with your electronic records.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on DoD-level standards for<br>records management software applications, as well as additional<br>background on preserving official records, please see the Records<br>Management FAQ .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
