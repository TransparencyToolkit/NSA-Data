DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) A Graduate's View of the ICSLP Class<br>FROM:<br>Chief of SIGINT Requirements<br>Run Date: 07/10/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) For three weeks in June I had the privilege to be a member of the Intelligence<br>Community Senior Leadership Program (ICSLP) class. This class is sponsored by the Director of<br>Central Intelligence (DCI) and is intended to bring together senior executives from across the<br>intelligence community to examine and discuss major issues affecting national security decision<br>making, intelligence strategies, interoperability, and intelligence support to the nation. Our class<br>also included for the first time a member of the Secret Service as a consumer of intelligence and<br>the class had the very good fortune to be mentored by <br>, a retired NSA senior<br>executive with significant CIA experience.<br>(U//FOUO) The tone of the class was set on the first full day of presentations with a discussion<br>led by the Honorable George J. Tenet, DCI. Mr. Tenet discussed the major issues facing the<br>intelligence community, his vision of the future, and his challenges to our class as a group of<br>leaders responsible for leading the intelligence community. In contrast to the abundant chatter<br>we have all heard over the past two years about an intelligence community reorganization, Mr.<br>Tenet instead emphasized the imperative of "horizontal integration" across the intelligence<br>community as the key to success. Other major themes that emerged included succession<br>planning; recruitment, training, and retention; compensation reform; and Agency responsibilities<br>to provide support to families of intelligence community personnel, especially those in extended<br>and dangerous field positions.<br>(U//FOUO) A great number of the presentations and discussions in the three weeks that followed<br>focused on these themes. Each ICSLP class travels for a week-long TDY to different intelligence<br>community-related places. Our class went to San Antonio to visit the Air Intelligence Agency<br>(AIA), the Medina Regional Security Operations Center (MRSOC), and the University of Texas at<br>San Antonio (UTSA). This was my first visit to an RSOC and it was a major eye-opener to the<br>entire class to see the type and quality of work being done by a largely very young workforce,<br>and their remarkable dedication in the performance of duties. It was also obvious where we<br>need to work harder to cement partnerships with the MRSOC. The UTSA visit drove home the<br>importance of partnerships between the intelligence and academic communities. Seeing the<br>work of groups of high school interns, university students and faculty working on information<br>assurance, steganography and many other issues in a school that prides itself in a very effective<br>cultural diversity program left us all in awe of what can be accomplished when one knows no<br>limits. The class also discovered that it is indeed possible to become tired of Mexican food while<br>maintaining a taste for Margaritas.<br>(U//FOUO) The discussion that tightly cemented the class together came in the last few days<br>when we heard from Mr. Jim Miklaszewski, the Pentagon correspondent for NBC News. An<br>articulate speaker, his discussion touched on the approach reporters take to gather, present,<br>and sometimes protect the information they report on. Class students quizzed him extensively<br>on the subject of leaks, obviously with consternation that any fellow community member would<br>provide privileged information to members of the press. One student drove home class feelings<br>on the subject by asking Mr. Miklaszewski how he differentiated reporter recruitment of US<br>intelligence sources from recruitment of foreign Humint sources when the US sources are<br>committing a felony by "leaking information" to reporters who are accessories after the fact. No<br>cogent answer was forthcoming.<br>(U//FOUO) Going into the class I assumed I was going to be lobotomized, become a "Stepford"<br>leader, conform with the rest. But from the beginning the class had been challenged to<br>remember that for us there is no "they" anymore-- we are now "they" and we bear the<br>responsibility to meet the challenges outlined by Mr. Tenet and the other speakers in order to<br>assure future increased success of the intelligence community through our own leadership.<br><br> </p>Leaving the class I had a far greater appreciation for the amazing things being accomplished<br>throughout the intelligence community, developed many friendships and contacts across the<br>community, and better understood some of my own individual responsibilities in the big picture<br>of things.<br>(U//FOUO) The only downside to the class was that I had to wait 20 years to get this<br>opportunity, one which should be offered far earlier in every employee's career.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
