A good example of this is the<br>WARGODDESS program. This is an effort to build information systems that fuse multiple sources<br>of data (mainly SIGINT, but also MASINT and IMINT) to give both intelligence producers and<br>operational warfighters dramatically improved battlespace awareness and target understanding.<br>By intelligently correlating and fusing multiple sources of signal data, a WARGODDESS- based<br>system can help characterize targets and threats and produce estimates about the targets and<br>their intentions.<br>(S//SI) What progress has been made so far? WARGODDESS systems have successfully<br>supported several military operations, including those in Afghanistan and Iraq. The system<br>directly supported the time-sensitive targeting of mobile surface-to-air-missile systems in Iraq<br>during the initial stages of the Operation Iraqi Freedom air campaign, producing a real-time<br>tracking picture. Members of Central Command Air Forces in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and South<br>Carolina praised SID's Ground Systems Office (GSO)-- the program office-- for the system's<br>performance and the individual efforts of all those involved. In addition, Lt Gen Mosley, the<br>Combined Forces Air Component Commander, personally thanked NSA Director Lt Gen Hayden<br>for this support.<br>(S//SI) As a result of this success, GSO has received numerous requests for additional systems<br>deployments both inside and outside the U.S. SIGINT System. The GSO team met with Lt Gen<br>Hayden on April 10th, and SID Director MG Quirk on May 5th for initial discussions on the way<br>forward for the WARGODDESS Program. In early May 2003, a WARGODDESS client was<br>deployed to Ramstein, Germany for the U.S. Air Force's 26 Information Operations Group (IOG)<br>operators to evaluate; and in mid-June an upgrade will be deployed to the system at the Medina<br>Regional Security Operations Center (MRSOC). In addition, it appears that the GSO leadership<br>may transition the WARGODDESS technology base to a larger program in future.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, contact the WARGODDESS Program Manager,<br> S33321, <br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
