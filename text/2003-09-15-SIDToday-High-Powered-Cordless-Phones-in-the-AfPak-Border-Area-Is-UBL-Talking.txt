Do<br>your targets operate in remote areas? Are your targets involved in illicit activities? If so, then<br>your targets might be using High Powered Cordless Phones (HPCP). HPCP networks are made up<br>of a base station and a given number of handsets, and can be found anywhere. They are<br>particularly common in rural areas with no infrastructure, and can be used as a standalone<br>network (sometimes called a "poor man's cell phone") or can be connected to any number of<br>devices that allow users to place international calls that would not be possible otherwise. HPCP<br>devices operate much like your cordless phone at home, with one major difference: imagine<br>getting in your car and using your cordless phone 50 miles away from your house!<br>(S//SI) The Afghanistan/Pakistan border region is the suspected location of Usama bin Laden<br>and his associates, but we think that we are missing some of their communications. The<br>Counterterrorism Product Line (CT) is currently developing HPCP networks operating in the<br>Afghanistan/Pakistan border areas in hopes of filling this intelligence gap. Thousands of<br>networks are operating along the Af/Pak border region, particularly in regions of known terrorist<br>activity such as the tribal areas of Pakistan. These networks are being documented in an<br>Agency-wide database so that analysts across the enterprise can share their findings.<br>(C//SI) Offices across the Agency as well as 2nd Party Partners and field elements are all<br>contributing to the HPCP effort. HPCP metadata for a number of countries is currently available<br>via the HOMEBASE data mart. Your targets might already be there!<br>(S//SI) If you would like to learn more, the HPCP Analysis Center (HAC) is sponsoring a<br>conference from 27-31 October 2003 . (Note from SIGINT Communications: see the related<br>article in today's SIDtoday for further details.)
