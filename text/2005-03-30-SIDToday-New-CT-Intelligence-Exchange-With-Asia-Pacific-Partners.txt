(S) New CT Intelligence Exchange With Asia-Pacific Partners
FROM: Charlie Meals
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Run Date: 03/30/2005

U.S. and seven other nations now sharing regional counterterrorism reporting (S//SI)
(S//SI) In 2004, the Director proposed that NSA take the lead in establishing a collaborative
effort to fight terrorism in the Asia-Pacific region. The pieces started falling into place in January
2005, when Australia, Canada, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the UK
announced their willingness to share intelligence on terrorist targets in the Asia-Pacific region.
(S) The inaugural meeting of this group, named SIGINT Seniors Pacific (SSPac), will not take
place until mid-April. However, as the Director stated when he addressed the group: "In these
dangerous times, I don't believe we can afford to move slowly." In response to that urgency, the
intelligence exchange began on 21 March with the U.S. forwarding sanitized reports to the seven
other SSPac members.
(S) While the bulk of the U.S.'s relevant reporting will likely come from the Counterterrorism
(CT) Product Lines here at NSA and at KRSOC, the global nature of the target and its association
with other targets of interest suggest that there will be occasions when relevant reports are
generated from other product lines, such as: S2A - Regional Targets; S2B - China/Korea; S2C International Security Issues; and S2E - MENA.
(S) The CT shop (S2I) has developed guidelines and provided instructions to the Partnership
Dissemination Cell (PDC) on how to select from its products for release to the SSPac members.
CT has named 12 terrorist groups as candidates for inclusion in this exchange and spelled out
the restrictions designed to meet both the classification limit (CAT 2) and the distribution
requirements of this collaboration. These guidelines have allowed the PDC to select appropriate
reporting for dissemination to the SSPac membership.
(U) I call upon all other SID product lines that might have material relevant to this exchange to
develop their own guidelines for sharing. By doing so, we can bring to the Asia-Pacific region, in
the Director's words: "the same, or even greater, cooperative watchfulness than the European
region now has."
