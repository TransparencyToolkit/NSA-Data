SPIN 15 VPN Story

VPN has two thrusts, one has high mission impacts and the other has high performance
and functionality impacts for Program B.

Mission impact - Start generating SIGINT from VPNs at SMK.

SMK is a VPN rich environment with targets of high value. Mission impact is high.
Consumers of the SIGINT reporting based on sources from SMK are at high levels of
government. NSA leadership has tasked CES to deploy decryption capabilities to SMK.
Security concerns have been addressed, SPFs have been signed to deploy TS//SI equities
to the S//SI site. VPN transformation tests have passed and capabilities ready for
deployment to the T-16 development server at SMK. To achieve a successful
deployment to SMK on the T-16s (first) and LPTs, the following are high level steps:

Task	Owner	Date
Load Spin 13 on T-16 DEV (first) and then T-16 LIVE system	Turmoil	March
Configure Blade 14 for PIQ Services Spin 13,	CES	March
Configure AMF/IslandHideaway for PIQ blade and VAO messaging traffic	AMF	March
Add IP tasking to Keycard for VPNs of interest	CES	March
Evaluate decrypted data in Xkeyscore for Strong Selectors	CES	March/April
Update Keycard with Strong Selectors	CES	March/April
Verify decrypted data which hits on a strong selector is forwarded from Turmoil to Pressurewave	CES	April
Verify analysts can retrieve the data from Pressurewave for reporting	CES	April
Identify Dell for PIQ Blade at SMK for LPT DEV system	CES	April
Load Spin (13/14 ?) on LPT DEV (first) and then the LPT LIVE Systems	Turmoil	May
Configure Dell for PIQ Services Spin 13.	CES	May

Add IP tasking to Keycard for VPNs of interest	CES	May

Update Keycard with Strong Selectors	CES	May/June
Verify decrypted data which hits on a strong selector is forwarded from Turmoil to Pressurewave	CES	June
Verify analysts can retrieve the data from Pressurewave for reporting	CES	June

Note: MDC upgrade and Site Store deployment at SMK will impact the VPN decryption
deployment. March 16-31 is the schedule for the upgrade and site store deployment.

VPN decryption deployment may slip due to availability.

Risk Reduction Activity for Program B

Program B Capabilities Document has provided Key Performance Paramerters (KPPs)
for VPN, In order to achieve the KPP identified for Sep 30, 2009, a risk reduction
activity has been initiated. This activity will gather performance benchmarks early in
SPIN 15 on the current architecture running on two 2.5G platforms, the T-16 Heavy and
the Dell LPT. Information from the performance benchmarks will indicate the level of
redesign (if any) needed to meet the KPPs. The following are the performance
requirements in Program B.

1.	NCC CA Service Requests (Decrypt) per hour (aggregate for all VPN exploitation-enabled systems).
Q4 FY09 (Risk 1,000 Reduction)	
Q4 FY10 10,000	
Q4FY11 100,000	
2.	NCC front end systems shall fully process (i.e. decrypt and re-inject) at least 20% of CA service requests (~20% Reinject Rate?)
3.	For tasked IP addresses, NCC front end systems shall identify relevant IPSec sessions and generate attack requests (Rates?)
4.	NCC front end systems shall buffer VPN data for up to 15 minutes (900 seconds) while waiting for response from Attack Orchestrater (AO)
5.	After successful key recovery and decryption PIQ services shall re-inject decrypted VPN for Stage 1 & Stage2 processing
6.	Aggregate VPN buffering and processing rate per TML system (Assumptions - LPT? T16? U64?)
Q4 FY09 (Risk 4 VPN 25 Concurrent VPN 100 Mbps Aggregate VPN Data / System

A schedule has been proposed to gather the performance benchmarks on current turmoil
2.5G systems (T-16 and LPT).
