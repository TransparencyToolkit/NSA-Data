(U) Reminder: 'Mapping the Global Future' Presentation -- Today
FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 03/24/2005

(U) David Gordon, Acting Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, will brief the NSA
workforce on "Mapping the Global Future: Report of the National Intelligence Council's 2020
Project" on 24 March from 1300 to 1430 in the Friedman Auditorium. This presentation is
sponsored by the SIGINT National Intelligence Officer (SINIO) Council and the Strategic
Intelligence Issues office (S17), which provided NSA support for the NIC 2020 Project.
Registration is not required.
(U) The NIC 2020 Project is the third unclassified report prepared by the National Intelligence
Council in recent years that takes a long-term look at the future. This study was the result of a
series of regional conferences and consultations with nongovernmental experts from five
continents. To provide additional support to this effort, the NIC constructed an interactive
website to facilitate global dialogue and submission of ideas and scenarios from around the
world.
(U) The NIC 2020 Project presents a new look at how current global trends and key drivers
might develop over the next 15 years. The goal of this effort was not to predict the future, but
to present a series of alternative scenarios that offer a range of possible futures. Four fictional
scenarios -- Davos World, Pax Americana, A New Caliphate and Cycle of Fear -- are developed
by the NIC and presented for those ready to to make a leap of imagination to the future and to
prepare for the challenges that this world will present to the Intelligence Community.
(U) This presentation will be videotaped, but it will not be broadcast.
(U//FOUO) A briefing on "Mapping the Global Future" is available on the NIC 2020 webpage ("go
nic2020").
