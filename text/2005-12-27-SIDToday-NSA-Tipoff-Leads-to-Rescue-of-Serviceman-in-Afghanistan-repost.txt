(S//SI) NSA Tipoff Leads to Rescue of Serviceman in Afghanistan

(U) This success story appeared on July 11, 2005:
(S//SI) Events surrounding the fate of a four-man Special Operational Forces team in
Afghanistan have made newspaper headlines in recent days. Sadly, two of the men were
confirmed killed, and efforts continue to locate a third. However, the fourth man was rescued,
with NSA playing a key role. Here's how the story unfolded:
(U) On June 28th, a Navy SEAL reconnaissance team operating in the Afghanistan/Pakistan
border area came under heavy fire from hostile militiamen and needed extraction. A Quick
Reaction Force deployed to pick up the men, but their Chinook helicopter was hit by a probable
rocket-propelled grenade while attempting to land. The helicopter crashed, rolled and caught
fire, leaving little chance for survivors. (The bodies were subsequently recovered.)
(TS//SI) Meanwhile, attempts to locate and rescue the SEALs continued. The NSOC Senior
Collection Officer (SCO) tasked the Meade Operations Center with assisting in the Search and
Rescue effort. On July 2nd, a young airman in the MOC's Tactical Research Cell picked up the tail
end of a transmission on a Search and Rescue frequency that was a deep male voice speaking
American English.
(TS//SI) The airman quickly directed geo-location efforts and in near real-time (using the SALEM
collection and COGS-X geolocation systems) obtained a centerpoint in an area about 50 km from
where the SEALs were expected to be and where search efforts were at that time underway.
Because of the apparent disparity in locations, military officials in Afghanistan requested MOC
confirmation of the geo-locational information, and following receipt of that confirmation
immediately launched another rescue mission. Just over two hours after the MOC tip-off, one of
the missing SEALs was recovered in the area of the geo-located signal.
(S//SI) The combined efforts of NSOC and the MOC directly contributed to the rescue of the
American serviceman in Afghanistan. This is an outstanding example of how SIGINTers can
really make a difference in savings lives. Well done!
