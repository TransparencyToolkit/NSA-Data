DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Leadership: Your View of People<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 08/21/2003<br><br>(U) Leadership is about working with people and it<br>really starts with how you look at them - how you<br>judge their motivation and their basic qualities. It<br>comes down to how do you take the measure of a person. Effective<br>leadership depends on getting this right, so listen up!<br>(U) Here's the first lesson: people are wonderful . They are, in<br>general, good and true. They can be trusted and will constantly<br>amaze and surprise you with their imagination and capacity for<br>innovative thought. Shakespeare: "What a piece of work is man!<br>How noble in reason. How infinite in faculty! In form and<br>movement how expressive and admirable. The beauty of the world;<br>the paragon of animals." Wow!<br>(U) First related revelation: this does not emanate from<br>social background, education, or ability to say "Down 'na<br>ocean" correctly. It is the natural state of human kind. This<br>trait allows us to live in large clusters and cooperate and<br>generally make giant leaps that we could never make alone.<br>Of course, this doesn't mean we aren't competitive. I saw<br>riding lawn mower races on TV last week. Jeesh! We'll race<br>anything that moves! But we will have rules and demand<br>that they are adhered to even as we do our best to beat out<br>the other guy. It is a pretty good combination to have basic<br>goodness and a competitive spirit. Naturally, there needs to<br>be balance in this (like so many things). When these get<br>out of balance, things do not go well. Leadership plays a<br>role in keeping that balance for the leader as well as the<br>"led".<br>(U) Second lesson: people are not perfect . Yeah, I know this is not<br>news, but why then do we have so much trouble accepting people<br>as imperfect and forgiving honest mistakes? The fact is that,<br>overall, people have a very low bit error rate. We make thousands<br>of decisions every day and put in tons of honest effort and rarely<br>make many mistakes. Even when we do, there are lots of external<br>factors helping to share the blame. The really good news is that we<br>are almost always working in a team environment where one<br>mistake can be easily made up for by the rest of the team. The<br>likelihood of the whole team all making a mistake simultaneously is<br>just about absolute zero. Even just two people teaming up bring<br>the chances of a major screw up to somewhere around nil.<br>(U) Second related revelation: we have to find a way to<br>flexibly try out new ideas, and team up to prevent the<br>stinkers from having too much of an effect. By the way,<br>making a mistake is an active notion. Doing nothing is the<br>only surefire way to avoid mistakes. I like the concept of an<br>engaged, active person trying out new ideas and<br>occasionally making a mistake, more than the potted plant<br>that never makes one. Leaders create an atmosphere where<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Charles Berlin<br>Discusses Leadership<br>1.  Leadership: Your<br>View of People<br>2.  Leaders Really Do<br>Make a Difference<br>3.  What Does a Leader<br>Do?<br>4.  Are Leaders Made or<br>Born?<br><br> </p>the active person constantly innovates safely. Leaders<br>constantly foster the notion of mutual support. Excellence is<br>having a stake in someone else's success.<br>(U) Third lesson: not all the people are doing well . Unlike Lake<br>Wobegone where all the women are strong, the men are good<br>looking and the children are all above average, there are some<br>people who are not performing well. Yes, it really is true. The good<br>news is that the ratio is not too bad. My experience is that around<br>95% of the people are doing well and meet the standards for<br>performance and conduct. This is a very good thing. About half of<br>the last 5% are not performing well but don't know it. A leader can<br>easily salvage these folks with mentoring, honest feedback and<br>corrective training. This also is a very good thing. Sad to say,<br>however, there remain a few percentage points of people who are<br>not performing well and know it - and some who actually are<br>screwing up on purpose. A leader supports all the others by quickly<br>and professionally moving these people on to another career,<br>somewhere else.<br>(U) Here's the last lesson: you work with and around the best<br>people in the world - they have courage, heart and compassion.<br>Consider yourself lucky, cherish this idea and remember it is a<br>privilege to lead Americans with a mission like ours. As a leader<br>you will necessarily have to judge performance and behavior, but<br>you need not judge your teammates as people - it has already<br>been established: they're the best.<br>(U) What is the foundation of your leadership? Do you think people<br>are basically good? Why would you want to lead? Can you really<br>make a difference?<br>(U) Next part: Leaders Really Do Make a Difference<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
