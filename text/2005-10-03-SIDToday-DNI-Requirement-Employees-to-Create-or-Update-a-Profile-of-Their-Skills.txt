(U//FOUO) DNI Requirement: Employees to Create or Update a
Profile of Their Skills
FROM:
Dancehall Team Lead (S01)
Run Date: 10/03/2005
(U//FOUO) A recent article acquainted you with the DANCEHALL Mission Readiness Database.
Beginning today, the following personnel will be called upon to update their skills profile in the
DANCEHALL/CVA database:
All S2 (Analysis and Production) employees -- civilian, military and reserve
Employees at the Global Cryptologic Centers (former RSOCs)
The S01 (SID/Integrated Planning) staff
SID/Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Eventually all of the SID organizations will be populating the database so that 1) SID has a
better picture of the overall skills of its workforce and 2) NSA's required input to the ARC
(Analytic Resources Catalog) is more complete.
(U) What is the ARC?
(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS, like every member of the Intelligence Community (IC), is required to
provide data on a semiannual basis to the Analytic Resources Catalog. The ARC was created in
2003 to inform the IC's most senior intelligence officials about analytic expertise in the
Community. The ARC resides in the office of the Deputy Director of National Intelligence for
Analysis (DDNI/A).
(U//FOUO) The ARC's centralized repository contains data on analysts' current assignments and
expertise, professional histories and experiences, and personal data -- such as education -- that
pertain to expertise. The ARC provides senior officials the capability to:
Identify specific analytic expertise across the IC
Know how many analysts are covering various targets
Leverage recruitment efforts
Support the DCI's annual response to the National Security Council on IC responsiveness
to the intelligence priority process (i.e. the NSPD-26/NIPF )
Respond to Congressional requests for information on analytic resources.
(U) How Will This Call-for-Data Work?
(U//FOUO) The call to enter or update skills data will be conducted by the Dancehall Team.
Although DANCEHALL also provides a means for applying for a vacant position, please remember
that the process of entering or updating your personal profile in Dancehall/CVA is different from
the process of volunteering for a new placement. Individuals who would like to be considered for
a specific position should follow the additional procedures described in DANCEHALL.
(U//FOUO) Please be assured that you will not be subjected to an involuntary directed
assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided. Furthermore, we have the
assurance of the DNI/Analysis that the ARC will not be used to locate mission experts within the
individual IC-member agencies for involuntary deployment to another mission or organization.
(U//FOUO) The Dancehall team will notify individual Product Lines when each is to
begin participating in the data-call. At that time, all members of the product line will be
provided with working aids and contact information for the Dancehall Team, should additional
assistance be required. The amount of time required varies depending on the breadth of target
expertise, but it is estimated that an average of 30 minutes of mission time per person is
required to complete a new professional skills entry; and about 5-10 minutes to review and
update an existing profile. The accuracy, integrity, and thoroughness of your responses are

 essential to conveying an appropriate picture of mission health within NSA and the analytic
capabilities of the IC. The data call must be completed by 100% of the workforce in the
organizations listed at the beginning of this article.
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL continues to evolve and the Dancehall Team is committed to making the
tool even easier and more user-friendly. Analysts in S2 and the Cryptologic Centers have already
offered many helpful suggestions to improve the tool. We encourage you to keep them coming.
Please send us feedback on the ease of use of the Dancehall/CVA application via the dl
dancehallteam (or 
nsa) alias.
(U//FOUO) The Dancehall Team and DNI ARC Program Managers thank you in advance for your
participation and cooperation. They can be reached at
