(U) Travel Alert and Travel Safely
FROM: 
SID OPSEC (S02L3)
Run Date: 08/10/2005

(U) On 4 August, in response to ongoing security concerns, the State Department issued a
Travel Advisory for the United Kingdom. In this advisory, all U.S citizens residing, visiting or
transiting through the UK were advised to "... maintain a high level of vigilance, take
appropriate steps to increase their security awareness and exercise caution in public places or
while using public transportation." It was issued in direct response to the recent terrorist
bombings in London as well as ongoing threat indicators.
(U) While this particular advisory deals directly with the current situation in the UK, we'd like to
use it as chance to remind all Agency employees that they should be alert, aware and smart
whenever they are out and about, be it at home or while on leave, TDY or PCS. At this time of
year, we have many of our folks traveling around the world in one capacity or another and we
want to remind all to keep what you've learned about OPSEC (Operations Security) and personal
security in mind at all times. Practice good situational awareness and don't hesitate to look or
question something two, three or more times if it doesn't look or feel "just right."
