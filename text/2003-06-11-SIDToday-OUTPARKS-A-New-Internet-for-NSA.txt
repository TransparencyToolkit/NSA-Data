Over time, those<br>connections and pseudo-networks deteriorated and were overcome by a growing user base that<br>increasingly demanded more and better Internet utility. Following the events of 11 September<br>2001, the need for greater Internet access and a vital, robust unclassified infrastructure became<br>clear. The exponential growth of AIRGAP throughout the Agency and the need for more<br>information and a refined collaborative atmosphere across government accelerated the demand<br>to consolidate NSA's unclassified systems.<br>(U//FOUO) Using SIGINT Directorate Internet access requirements as a foundation, the<br>modernization of our unclassified environment - OUTPARKS - began almost as soon as Eagle<br>Alliance came onboard. It was a huge task. Years of legacy systems, patched connections,<br>redundant routers and servers, outdated equipment, old software and scores of other issues had<br>to be removed or resolved and new, streamlined procedures and modern equipment installed.<br>(U//FOUO) Machines currently resident on older systems will automatically connect to<br>OUTPARKS. As a result, users won't have to be concerned about having a BRAZEN or NIPRNet or<br>OSIS or AIRGAP machine. Rather, there will be an Internet terminal from which one will connect<br>to the World Wide Web and still be able to access data or connections particular to those<br>systems. Except for AIRGAP, there will be no need to logon to different services individually and<br>users will have their choice of "user-friendly" email accounts.<br>(U//FOUO) The first integration is expected by Summer 2004 when some BRAZEN users will be<br>moved to the new network. With that initial transfer, OUTPARKS will begin to provide the NSA<br>unclassfied user population with an expanded, more secure, state-of-the-art network.<br>(U//FOUO) Ideas are already being discussed for using OUTPARKS to deliver the Internet with as<br>little desktop clutter possible. This includes the display of Internet and classified data on a single<br>desktop monitor. We also want to extend the Internet to the widest audience possible, including<br>the Extended Enterprise. Field connectivity to OUTPARKS (or OUTPARKS technology) would allow<br>those remote users the same state-of-the-art functionality, security and accesses available at<br>NSAW.<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to modernized connectivity, SID intends to enhance Internet user skills.<br>Efforts such as Robyn Winder's annual volume " Untangling the Web: An Introduction To<br>Internet Research " and her monthly " The WorthWhile Web " are excellent resources for<br>learning about the intricacies of navigating the Internet effecitvely and safely. In addition to<br>these publications and other Internet Research assistance, we will be looking for ways to make<br>the SID population more Internet savvy.<br>(U//FOUO) OUTPARKS is a major step in modernizing and transforming NSA. With faster, more<br>advanced, managed and protected access to the Internet and a more knowledgeable workforce,<br>the entire SIGINT Enterprise will be able to effectively integrate the huge information resource<br>that is the Internet into the intelligence process.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information, see: SID Internet Program and SIGINT Success Stories .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
