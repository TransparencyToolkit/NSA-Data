Something to read while sipping your morning beverage... (U)
(U//FOUO) People sometimes ask about SID today's readership. Numbers aren't everything, of
course, but we do monitor the stats to see which topics appear to be of greatest interest. Here
are some figures from last month (May):
Unique visitors (i.e. how many different people accessed the page during the month):
17,654
Total visits (a "visit" is defined as a session spent on the website accessing the articles or
files contained in it): 114,609
Average visits per SID today edition: 5,458
(U//FOUO) Keep in mind that people outside of SID sometimes read SID today too, so it's not
possible to directly equate the stats with percentages of the SID population. SIGINTers in the
field and others in NSA also tune in.
(U//FOUO) In case you were wondering, the most widely read article in May was the Redesign of
A&P piece with 13,756 visits.
(U) At the end of every SID today article you can find a link to a feedback page -- if you see an
article you like (or don't), please tell us your views.

"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet
without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."
