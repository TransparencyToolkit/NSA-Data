The official<br>promotion list will be forthcoming soon, pending notification of all recipients. These individuals<br>selected for advancement have made outstanding contributions to SID and the Agency, and<br>have played a major role in the great successes we have achieved over the past year. Given the<br>tremendous talent resident in the SID workforce, it is no easy feat to be singled out for such<br>recognition! We, the SID Leadership Team, heartily congratulate the promotees and look<br>forward to even greater things from them in future.<br>(U//FOUO) As you know, this year we also committed a large portion of our remaining awards<br>money for the promotion cycle towards Quality Step Increases (QSI), Sustained Superior Work<br>Performance (SSWP), and Special Achievement Awards (SAA), to reward outstanding performers<br>for their contributions. Additionally, we take particular pride in the number of Team Awards<br>which were allocated, since so much of our work depends upon group efforts. The competition<br>for these SID awards was likewise very steep, and we highly commend the outstanding<br>accomplishments of each and every recipient.<br>(U//FOUO) We are well aware that the SID workforce is the very foundation of SID's success. As<br>a result, our goal is to reward appropriately, within our monetary constraints, all who perform<br>with excellence. We realize that not all who are deserving have received recognition, but we are<br>committed to rewarding outstanding performance to the fullest extent possible.<br>(U) Please join us in congratulating SID's honorees-- they've done a fantastic job!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
