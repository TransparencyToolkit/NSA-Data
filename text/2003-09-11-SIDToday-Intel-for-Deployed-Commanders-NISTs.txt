The<br>answer: a NIST. The mission of the National Intelligence Support Team (NIST) is to provide<br>timely national level all-source intelligence to deployed commanders during crisis or contingency<br>operations. In the aftermath of September 11, the NIST office has been busier than ever before<br>in executing that mission. From Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan to Operation<br>IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), NSA personnel have been deployed as part of NISTs, and there is no sign<br>of the workload lessening any time soon.<br>(U//FOUO) The NIST program falls under the authority of the JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) J-2<br>(Director of Intelligence). Teams are deployed all around the world and consist of<br>representatives from all over the Intelligence Community, such as NSA, CIA, DIA, and NIMA.<br>Once in the field, the team members are charged with a variety of tasks, and they must undergo<br>extensive training to be prepared. Personnel go through a three-month training process covering<br>medical, weapons, tactical vehicle, and analysis training, just to name a few. Following this<br>training, the NIST members are sent to an Area of Operations marshalling point to await their 34 month deployment.<br>(U//FOUO) Upon arrival in the field, individuals are responsible for "reach-back" (i.e.<br>coordinating with members of their home organization) in order to provide an "all-source"<br>picture for support to the field commanders. The analysis they conduct directly supports the<br>military's real-time operations; it often is a key factor as the commander makes the "go/no go"<br>decision to execute a mission. Other functions of the NSA NIST personnel include threatwarning, time-sensitive RFIs (Requests for Information), deconfliction of reporting, and collection<br>management.<br>(U//FOUO) The NIST program has been around since the first Gulf War. The program has<br>evolved over the last decade into a vital crisis-reaction force, and recent years have seen that<br>need grow exponentially. The NIST brings NSA closer to the fight than any other program.
