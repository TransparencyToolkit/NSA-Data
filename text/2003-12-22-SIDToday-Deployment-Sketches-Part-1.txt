I had initially thought I would volunteer to support my<br>parent service (USAF), however, I decided the NIST was the way<br>to go - I could use the experience I gained in the Geospatial<br>Exploitation Office and apply it at the front lines. My team was<br>deployed from 9 March to 8 June (give or take). One team<br>member,<br>already wrote an article, so I will try not to<br>be repetitious.<br>(U//FOUO) I was part of our "advance team" which included the<br>team Officer in Charge (OIC) and a "comms guy". We flew from<br>BWI on a chartered flight along with another advance team from<br>NSA going to support the I MEF. We arrived at Doha, Kuwait, got<br>shown to some warehouses to catch up on sleep, and then were<br>convoyed about an hour north to Camp Virginia. The first day we<br>were at Doha was my first experience with a combat situation. We<br>had a SCUD drill in the middle of that first afternoon - I admit, once<br>I got my mask and suit on, I fell asleep. I was just too tired from<br>the flight (BWI to Shannon, Ireland, to Cypress, to Doha).<br> <br>NSA's Baghdad teams attend Musketeer brief<br>(U//FOUO) When we got to Camp Virginia (in Kuwait), we were<br>shown to a Bedouin tent with about 60 other cots in it. We would<br>stay there until the rest of the team showed up. I stepped outside<br>with my toothbrush, and asked a staff sergeant where should I<br>brush my teeth. She pointed at the ground. So that's where we<br>brushed our teeth - outside, with a bottle of water, and we spit on<br>the ground.<br>(U//FOUO) Our mission when we arrived at Camp Virginia was to<br>support the Army's V Corps. Even though seven years of my 10<br>years of Air Force experience has been in joint assignments, this<br>was different. In fact, except for the NSA team, the rest of the<br>personnel were Army. We first had to establish relationships with<br>the watch-center personnel, and the G-2 (i.e. the Intelligence<br>Director).<br>(C) I think as a team, we did really well. We bribed the G-2 and<br>the warrant officers with our gourmet coffee. We did the very best<br>to remember that we weren't out there to just pass serialized<br>product reports from the TOPIs or make read files: we were out<br>there to leverage all of NSA's assets to keep the troops ahead of us<br>alive. We produced actionable intelligence from NSA information.<br>(S) One night, I came across a target, got up, walked five steps to<br>the Artillery Officer, and it was on the list to be destroyed literally<br>that fast. Later, our comms team set up an NSTS line from our<br>desk to the artillery desk, and then ran another line out to the<br>operations floor to the Brigadier General in charge of targets, so<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.
