(S//SI) SIGINT Seniors Pacific - An Update
FROM: 
Chief of the Foreign Affairs Directorate's Asia/TransAsia Office (DP15)
Run Date: 06/09/2005

(S) For background on the SSPac, see the article (S) New CT Intelligence Exchange With AsiaPacific Partners
(S//SI) The initial meeting of the SSPac Principals took place last month, hosted by NSA at
Camp Smith, Hawaii. This was the first opportunity for all eight founding member nations
(Australia, Canada, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, SIngapore, UK, and US) to meet
and discuss the overall scope of the initiative, topics of concern, a concept of operations
(CONOP), and to hear each other 's perspectives on counterterrorism (CT).
(S//SI) Overall, the conference was a resounding success, with all nations contributing to the
discussions, providing individual national briefings on CT efforts, and expressing a commitment
to support the SSPac initiative.
(S//SI) The Principals agreed to the:
Establishment of a formal Principals Board, chaired by DIRNSA.The Principals will provide
overall requirements,direction,and resource allocation for SSPac initiatives; 
Establishment of an Executive Board (EB), which will be responsible for execution of the
initiatives/requirements defined by the Principals, and reporting status and results; 
Endorsement of the CONOP, which was drafted by NSA and provided to the other nations
six weeks before the conference in order to solicit feedback and comment. A revised
CONOP, defining the multinational SIGINT sharing level agreement, the board charters,
intelligence exchange, and topics of interest, has been drafted and will undergo a final
membership review shortly; 
Endorsement of an intelligence exchange on CT. The initial focus for SSPac will be to
share intelligence on CT, with the understanding that CT encompasses a broad definition
(e.g. banking information, follow-the-people, etc.). Additional topics such as
counterproliferation will be considered at a later date. 
(S//SI) NSA has established a communications path to each of the SSPac members and
is actively sharing CT product with each of the SSPac members.
(S//SI) SSPac will provide a forum for the informal exchange of information and ideas to meet
mutual intelligence requirements in time of peace, risk, crisis, conflict, and war. The initial focus
on CT is intended to provide warning of imminent terrorist threats to member nations, maximize
the opportunity to exchange SIGINT-derived or SIGINT-enabled information on terrorist groups
and their plans in order to prevent attacks or threatening situations, and provide a mechanism
for getting actionable SIGINT derived information into the hands of entities that are in a position
to take action upon it.
