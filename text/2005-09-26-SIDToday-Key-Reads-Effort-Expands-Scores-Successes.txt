(C//SI) 'Key Reads' Effort Expands, Scores Successes
FROM:
Requirements Analysis Center (S114)
Run Date: 09/26/2005

(U//FOUO) "Key Reads" process is intended to answer short-fused requests for specific SIGINT
information.
(U//FOUO) Last year the Customer Relationships Directorate introduced the Key Reads process .
Key Reads are defined as a customer-driven information need tied to a specific, near-term
(generally less than 72 hours) customer event, action, decision or outcome. This process allows
production elements to adjust reporting emphasis, and synchronize production efforts with timecritical high priority needs of the customer.
(C//SI) When the Key Reads tool was in its earliest developmental stage, it was provided to
CENTCOM for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) needs. With the success of the OIF initiative, a Key
Reads expansion effort, to include additional topics and a wider customer base, was
implemented. To date, the expansion has included:
Global Economics,
North Korea,
Latin America,
Information Operations, and
Europe.
The remaining Key Reads topics include Near East/South Asia, followed by China, Russia, Africa,
and Asia Pacific, with completion of the roll-out scheduled by the end of CY-2005.
(S//SI) While the Key Read process continues to expand, evolve, and improve, customers and
analysts are already experiencing positive results. One recent Key Read success story
included a drug interdiction effort. A Key Read was submitted by CSG Key West on behalf of
Joint Interagency Task Force - South (JIATF-S) regarding information needed on a particular
vessel suspected of transporting narcotics. The Key Read provided both background data and
specific reporting requirements.
(S//SI) Given a very specific intelligence requirement, and the knowledge that this was a priority
for JIATF-S, analysts in the Mexico-Central America-Caribbean Narcotics Branch (S2F12) were
able to focus attention on the particular vessel of interest and immediately report on any related
traffic received. As a result, S2F12 analysts issued 4 serialized reports (Egrams and SIGINT-onDemand) that provided actionable SIGINT to JIATF-S.
(C) The following was provided by CSG Key West on behalf of JIATF-S as feedback to the reports
S2F12 analysts issued in response to the Key Read:
(S//SI) "The mission of the JIATF-S is to detect, monitor and, with law-enforcement assistance,
interdict illicit trafficking. This series of reports led directly to the boarding and searching of the
M/V CALA PINO by Her Majesty's Customs and Revenue after it arrived in Lisbon, Portugal. 
--Interim CSG Chief, 
.
(U//FOUO) We anticipate this to be one of many future Key Read success stories. For more
