ORANGECRUSH, part of the OAKSTAR program under 
corporate portfolio, began forwarding metadata from a third party partner
site (Poland) to NSA repositories as of 3 March and content as of 25 March.
This program is a collaborative effort between 550, NCSC, ETC, FAD, an NSA
Corporate Partner and a division of the Polish Government. ORANGECRUSH is
only known to the Poles as BUFFALOGREEN. This multi?group partnership
began in May 2009 and will incorporate the OAKSTAR project of ORANGEBLOSSOM
and its DNR capability. The new access will provide SIGINT from commercial
links managed by the NSA Corporate Partner and is anticipated to include
Afghan National Army, Middle East, limited African continent, and European
communications. A notification has been posted to SPRINGRAY and this
collection is available to Second Parties via TICKETWINDOW.
