Gregory Wessel, Technical Director for SIGINT Development<br>, was nice enough to oblige:<br>(U) Question: What do you consider the role of a DISL to be? How does it differ from that of a<br>GS employee or a DISES?<br>(U//FOUO) The DISL over the last years has taken on two roles; one of a Technical Leader and<br>one of a Technical Expert.<br>(U//FOUO) A DISL Technical Leader works at the office or group level formulating strategic<br>vision, making architectural and framework recommendations, ensuring technology<br>transformation and workforce technical health, steering technical requirements in development<br>efforts, and looking out for the health and well-being of the mission. They also create<br>mechanisms to interact with the workforce, enablers, and outside technical boards to ensure<br>that the best technical advice is obtained on any issues. They serve as a sounding board and<br>sanity check for new technical ideas and recommendations from the workforce and assist the<br>DISES in running the corporation.<br>(U//FOUO) The DISL Technical Expert is a recognized expert in his/her field, possessing both the<br>breadth and depth of expertise in the skill sets related to his/her areas of specialization acquired<br>via formally documented and peer-acknowledged academic qualifications and mission work. Of<br>considerable importance are personal and team accomplishments, achievements in their field of<br>expertise, continuous learning to stay on the cutting edge. One of the major functions a DISL<br>should perform in the mentoring of junior and senior analysts throughout the agency.<br>(U//FOUO) The DISL differs from a DISES in a number of ways. A DISES has a contract with<br>NSA to lead/manage people and change, build coalitions within the building and with<br>partners/customers, and develop and employ business acumen to acquire and administer<br>human, financial, material, and information resources to run the corporation. A DISL is<br>responsible for the technical leadership and expertise to aid the DISES in carrying out his/her<br>duties for NSA.<br>(U) Question: What is the best part of being a DISL? ...the hardest part?<br>(U) The best part of being a DISL is having the ability to influence the decision-making<br>processes, provide technical advice and guidance, and drive technology transformation at the<br>office and group level for the corporation. In addition to those listed above, being able to provide<br>technical leadership and mentoring to other agency employees is exciting and rewarding.<br>(U) For DISLs who are more technical experts in their fields, being recognized as that is very<br>satisfying in itself. But more important is making breakthroughs in areas that have remained<br>difficult challenges for the Agency. Having a parking place is also a major perk for a DISL.<br>(U) The hardest part of being a DISL is not having the governance authority to make decisions.<br>This is still seen as one of the DISES roles for the corporation.<br>(U) Question: What are the "must have" talents a person needs to succeed as a DISL?<br>(U) Depending on the type of DISL (leader or expert), they need to have a broad range of<br>technical talents or be very deeply entrenched in their area of expertise. The DISL needs to have<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">the ability to provide technical guidance to help influence decision-making by the DISES and<br>have the talents to mentor and guide others careers. In addition, the DISL needs to have the<br>attitude that their opinions and technical advice are valued by the corporation and should be<br>heeded.<br>(U) Question: What advice would you give to someone who would like to become a DISL?<br>What training/experience should that person seek out?<br>(U) Anyone wishing to become a DISL needs to either have broad technical leadership abilities<br>with a proven track record of technical accomplishments or have deep technical expertise in a<br>discipline and be a recognized go-to person by other agency employees and seniors. Those who<br>become DISLs are often ones that don't shy away from the hardest problems facing the agency<br>and instead make significant contributions.<br>(U//FOUO) The only formal training program for DISLs is the Senior Technical Development<br>Program (STDP). The STDP is a career development program structured to build NSA's<br>technical/professional leaders for the next decade. In addition to the formal program, a DISL<br>want-to-be can take leadership training through the NCS and also technical academic training to<br>enhance their technical skills and expertise.<br>(U//FOUO) We hope to interview a DISES next... stay tuned!<br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
