Run Date: 01/06/2005

(S//SI) Signals Intelligence Director MG Quirk hosted this year's NSA-CSE* SIGINT Bilateral
Conference on 15-16 November in Columbia, Maryland. MG Quirk kicked off the first day of the
conference by briefing the Governance Model, SID's intelligence outlook for the next 5 years
(i.e., challenges, requirements and services), as well as its mission alignment strategy with
regards to the RSOCs. Bob Brule, Deputy Chief, CSE SIGINT, reciprocated by sharing
information on the implications of Canada's National Security Policy on CSE, and provided an
update on the Integrated SIGINT Operational Model (ISOM), which is aimed at increasing the
integration of CSE and Canadian Forces SIGINT operations.
(S//SI) The second day provided an opportunity for NSA and CSE to exchange lessons learned
from the Olympics, NATO Summit and Support to Military Operations (SMO) efforts in Haiti,
Afghanistan and Iraq. In recognition for the outstanding support provided by a CSE'er to the
counterterrorism effort, Wayne Murphy, Production Manager for Counterterrorism, presented
Bob with a memento. Briefings and discussions on NSA's Russia Mission and Strategic
Architecture, CNO (Computer Network Operations) collaborative efforts and future direction
within both a bilateral and 5-Eyes context, as well as maritime security wrapped up the bilateral
exchanges.
(S//SI) Considered a success by both sides, the conference ended with participants looking
forward to future and continued discussions on maritime security, CNO and more. Passing
reference was made to the 5-Eyes Analysis and Production Conference that was being hosted by
CSE on 7-8 December, and CSE pointed out that strengthening its partnerships within the 5Eyes community remains a priority. Finally, there was joint agreement to continue collaborative
efforts to further develop the entire SIGINT enterprise.
