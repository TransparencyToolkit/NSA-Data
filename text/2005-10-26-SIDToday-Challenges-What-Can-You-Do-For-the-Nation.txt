(U) Challenges - What Can You Do For the Nation?
FROM:
CENTCOM Account Manager (S113)
Run Date: 10/26/2005

(S//SI) In the last installment, we looked at CENTCOM's top
missions and how NSA/CSS has placed over 300 people in the field
to be with our customer face-to-face. We also showed that about
31% of NSA/CSS's analytic workforce is working on CENTCOM
targets, resulting in over 36,000 serialized reports over a 13month period.
(S//SI) Today, we will talk about the challenges we face in
supporting CENTCOM in Iraq, Afghanistan, the war on terrorism,
and the rest of its area of responsibility - and issue a challenge to
you to consider what you can contribute to the fight.
(U) Challenges
(S//REL) Nearly all of the NSA/CSS positions (non-SCS) supporting
CENTCOM overseas are 90-180 day rotational slots (see graphic ).
Maintaining this steady flow of quality, trained, personnel
has been a challenge - and CENTCOM's requirements call for
even more people. A number of SID today articles, and messages
from NSA/CSS leadership have described the great benefits of such
a tour: directly fighting the war on terror, unique learning
experience, focused mission with tangible results, and no long term
commitment to overseas service, to name a few. There are also
positions available at CENTCOM Headquarters in Tampa, Florida. If
you want to be part of this exciting and life-changing mission,
please contact NCR CENTCOM Chief of Staff,
, 
.
(S//SI//REL) Another challenge is meeting the growing
requirements for language support for CENTCOM targets.
There is an ongoing shortage in Pashto, Arabic, Dari, Kurdish, and
other languages. While the Armed Services have recently ramped
up training in these vital areas, it takes a lot of experience to
become an operationally effective analyst. To help expand the
linguist pool, the Agency continues to recruit native and non-native
linguists in these languages, is streamlining hiring and operational
processes, and is opening Regional Language Centers. You can
earn $1000 for every language analyst, native-level or not, you
refer who is successfully hired (see also the referral program
webpage and a related article from Charlie Meals ).
(TS//SI) While NSA/CSS continues to deliver superb SIGINT to
CENTCOM, resulting in the killing, capture, and disruption of the
top terrorist targets, the intelligence challenges are not yet all
met. Iranian and Pakistani leadership plans and intentions,
actionable intelligence to stop the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq,
and growing terrorism targets and crises (such as the London
Bombings) are all top priorities for the SIGINT system.
(TS//SI) In some cases, the problem is access to the target
communications. The Collection Strategies and Requirements

 SERIES: 
(U) SID Support to
CENTCOM
1.  Meet the Central
Command
2.  Challenges - What
Can You Do For the
Nation?
3.  CENTCOM's 'Long
War'

 Center, the Commercial Solutions Center, Foreign Affairs
Directorate, and Analysis and Production Directorate, all work
together, and with other Agencies, to create amazing access
solutions. In other cases, the problem is putting sufficient analysts
to work against competing top target priorities. Through it all,
NSA's commitment to mission success is very evident to CENTCOM
through long hours, policy changes, prioritization of targets, and
allocation of resources.
(C) In the next installment: CENTCOM's plan for the "Long War" in
the region.
