(U//FOUO) New Cell to Make SIGINT Assessment Reporting 'All That
It Can Be'
FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
Run Date: 09/13/2005

(U//FOUO) Customers eagerly devour SIGINT Assessment Reports **, and now a new cell is
standing up to lead the production effort.
(U//FOUO) On 19 September, a new reporting element will begin operations in the Analysis and
Production Directorate -- the SIGINT Assessment Cell. This new Cell has been created as a
direct response to the positive customer feedback and the high value our customers place on
assessment reporting. As we look to the future and building our relationships with our
customers, I believe it is time to establish a mechanism to improve our ability to share analytical
insights and perspectives with those customers, and the SIGINT Assessment Cell is charged with
leading that effort.
(U//FOUO) The primary missions of the SIGINT Assessment Cell will be to:
focus on the art and tradecraft of the SIGINT Assessment,
ensure that, as appropriate, various lines of reporting are synthesized into a "big picture"
analysis
produce tailored reports, SIGINT Assessment reports and analytical insights for senior
policy makers, combatant commanders and senior intelligence officials
enhance the ability of analysts across the SIGINT system to share their insight and
perspective
facilitate S2's engagement in the Presidential Daily Brief process
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Assessment Cell will be composed of a small team of senior analysts at
the A&P Staff level under operational control of the Chiefs. This will ensure that assessments will
not only cross various production centers and target sets, it will also have the access to
leadership across the enterprise needed to begin influencing the direction for the future of the
tradecraft. This is an exciting opportunity for analysts to develop skills and advance in the
organization as technical leaders in the field of intelligence analysis and reporting.
(U//FOUO) I must stress that the purpose of the SIGINT Assessment Cell is not to add a layer or
to provide competition for any individual product line; rather, its purpose is to harness and
institutionalize best practices of providing SIGINT to the nation by leveraging the brainpower of
analysts across the SIGINT system.
(U//FOUO) Stay tuned for further announcements regarding the Cell's development and
progress. If you have any questions, please contact its Chief, 
.
**(U) What Is a SIGINT Assessment? 
(S//SI) When an analyst produces a SIGINT Assessment Report, he compiles "everything we've
got" on a certain topic, analyzes it, and presents conclusions based on the intelligence.
Customers greatly appreciate these reports not only for their scope, but because they contain
the full insights of SIGINT analysts who, in many cases, have followed the topic for years. ( For a

to Happen . )
