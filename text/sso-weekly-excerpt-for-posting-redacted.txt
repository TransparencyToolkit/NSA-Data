Speaker's Notes

From Feb 28 2013: Proposed/imminent latest DO/Volume reduction: Narchive

BLUF: Requested S2 concurrence at S2 TLC on 25 Feb with partial throttling of content from Yahoo, Narchive email traffic which
contains data older than 6 months from MUSCULAR. Numerous S2 analysts have complained of its existence, and the relatively
small intelligence value it contains does not justify the sheer volume of collection at MUSCULAR (1/4th of the total daily collect).

Background: Since July of 2012, Yahoo has been transferring entire email accounts using the Narchive data format (a proprietary
format for which NSA had to develop custom demultiplexers). To date, we are unsure why these accounts are being transferred -
movement of individuals, backup of data from overseas servers to US servers, or some other reason. There is no way currently to
predict if an account will be transferred via Yahoo Narchive.

Currently, Narchive traffic is collected and forwarded to NSA for memorialization in any quantity only from DS-200B. On any given
day, Narchive traffic represents 25% (15GB) of DS-200B's daily PINWALE content allocation (60GB currently). DS-200B is scheduled
to be upgraded in the summer of 2013; it is likely that memorialized Narchive traffic, if still present in the environment, will grow
proportionally (i.e. double now, to 30 GB/day).

Narchive traffic is mailbox formatted email, meaning unlike Yahoo webmail, any attachments present would be collected as part of
the message. This is a distinct advantage. However, it has not been determined what causes an Narchive transfer of an account, so
these messages are rarely collected "live".

Based on analysis of Narchive email data	and|

communications date for Narchive email messages collected:

, we were able to indentify statistics for the original

< 30 days	1118	11%

> 30 days, < 90 days	1758	17%
> 90 days < 180 days	1302	13%
> 180 days, < 1 year	2592	26%
> 1years, < 5 years	3084	31%
> 5years	154	>1%

Numerous target offices have complained about this collection "diluting" their workflow. One argument for keeping it is that it
provides a retrospective look at target activity - this argument is hampered by a) the unreliable and non-understood nature of when
the transfer occurs for an account, and b) that FISA restrospective collection would retrieve the exact same data "on demand".

SSO Optimization believes that while this is "valid" collection of content, the sheer volume and the age - coupled with the
unpredictable nature of Narchive activity - makes collecting older data a less desirable use of valuable resources. 59% of Narchive
email collected was originally sent and received more than 180 days after collection. This represents about 8.9 GB a day of "less
desirable" collection - long term allocation that could be easily filled with more timely, useful FI from this lucrative SSO site. As
always with our optimization, the data would still be available at the site store for SIGDEV. This would not impact metadata
extraction.
