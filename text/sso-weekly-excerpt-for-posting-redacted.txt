Speaker?s Notes

From Feb 28 2013: Proposed/imminent latest DO/Volume reduction: Narchive

BLUF: Requested 52 concurrence at 52 TLC on 25 Feb with partial throttling of content from Yahoo, Narchive email traffic which
contains data older than 6 months from MUSCULAR. Numerous 52 have complained of its existence, and the relatively
small intelligence value it contains does not justify the sheer volume of collection at MUSCULAR (1/4th of the total daily collect).

Background: Since July of 2012, Yahoo has been transferring entire email accounts using the Narchive data format (a proprietary
format for which NSA had to develop custom demultiplexers). To date, we are unsure why these accounts are being transferred 
movement of individuals, backup of data from overseas servers to US servers, or some other reason. There is no way currently to
predict if an account will be transferred via Yahoo Narchive.

Currently, Narchive traffic is collected and forwarded to NSA for memorialization in any quantity only from DS-2008. On any given
day, Narchive traffic represents 25% (15GB) of daily PINWALE content allocation (60GB currently). DS-2008 is scheduled
to be upgraded in the summer of 2013; it is likely that memorialized Narchive traffic, if still present in the environment, will grow
proportionally double now, to 30 GB/day).

Narchive traffic is mailbox formatted email, meaning unlike Yahoo webmail, any attachments present would be collected as part of
the message. This is a distinct advantage. However, it has not been determined what causes an Narchive transfer of an account, so
these messages are rarely collected "live".

 

Based on analysis of Narchive email data and_, we were able to indentify statistics for the original
communications date for Narchive email messages collected:

30 days 1118 11%
30 days, 90 days 1758 17%
90 days 180 days 1302 13%
180 days, 1 year 2592 26%
1years, 5 years 3084 31%
5years 154 

Numerous target offices have complained about this collection "diluting" their workflow. One argument for keeping it is that it
provides a retrospective look at target activity this argument is hampered by a) the unreliable and non-understood nature of when
the transfer occurs for an account, and b) that FISA restrospective collection would retrieve the exact same data "on demand?.

SSO Optimization believes that while this is "valid" collection of content, the sheer volume and the age coupled with the
unpredictable nature of Narchive activity makes collecting older data a less desirable use of valuable resources. 59% of Narchive
email collected was originally sent and received more than 180 days after collection. This represents about 8.9 GB a day of "less
desirable? collection long term allocation that could be easily filled with more timely, useful from this lucrative 550 site. As
always with our optimization, the data would still be available at the site store for SIGDEV. This would not impact metadata
extraction.
