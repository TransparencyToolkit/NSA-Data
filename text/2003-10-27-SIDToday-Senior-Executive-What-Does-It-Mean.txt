But do you<br>really know what a senior executive is? How is one selected to be a<br>senior? And do all seniors work as managers? For answers to these<br>questions and more, read on . . .<br>(U) The Concept<br>(U//FOUO) Why do we have seniors? The rationale is that the<br>Agency needs a cadre of leaders who have the experience and skills<br>needed to help run the Agency. The Agency works to prepare highpotential candidates from within NSA for these positions, and also<br>seeks qualified personnel from outside the Agency. To help NSA<br>attract and keep talented leaders, seniors are also offered higher<br>pay rates than GS employees.<br>(U) The Two Kinds of Seniors: Managers (DISES) and Technical<br>Leaders (DISL)<br>(U//FOUO) Seniors are divided into two categories: managers and<br>technical experts. Managers belong to the Defense Intelligence<br>Senior Executive Service (DISES) , and technical experts<br>belong to the Defense Intelligence Senior Level (DISL) . While<br>both DISES and DISLs are recognized as Agency leaders, having<br>the two categories gives DISLs the opportunity to remain focused<br>on technical endeavors and not get bogged down with managerial<br>duties. (See related information from NSA On-Line.)<br>(U//FOUO) Candidates may receive special leadership training to<br>prepare them for these senior positions. For example, the Senior<br>Leadership Candidate Development Program (SLCDP) gives<br>trainees the broad exposure and managerial training they will need<br>to fill DISES positions. Similarly, the Senior Technical Development<br>Program (STDP) helps develop technical skills needed for DISL<br>positions.<br>(U) How Many Seniors are there in SID, and What Percentage of<br>the SID Workforce Are They?<br>(C) NSA's current DISES/DISL ceiling is 420. Of the 420, no more<br>than 295 can be DISES. NSA presently has 249 DISES and 151<br>DISLs (a total of 400). Of these, 82 DISES and 76 DISLs (a total of<br>158) are in SID. You can contrast this with the SID civilian<br>population of GG15 and below - about 6200 - which means that<br>seniors represent roughly 2.5% of the SID workforce.<br>(U) Coming in part 2: How Are Seniors Selected and Assigned?<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Senior Execs<br>1.
