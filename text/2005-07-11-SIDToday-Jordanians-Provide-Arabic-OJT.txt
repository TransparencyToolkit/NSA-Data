(S//SI) Jordanians Provide Arabic OJT
FROM:
(S//SI) Country Desk Officer Jordan (DP14)
Run Date: 07/11/2005

(S//SI) Four language analysts from NSA/CSS Georgia arrived in Jordan on 26 May to receive
on-the-job Arabic language training from the Jordanian Electronic Warfare Directorate (EWD).
The students, who will be in Jordan for approximately 30 days, will sit with Jordanian analysts at
the various collection sites listening to and transcribing raw collection. This training will be
ongoing, with different groups deploying periodically. Once the initial four students have the
training, there will be another group of four ready to go for FY05.
(S//SI) FAD's* Foreign Affairs Officers (FAOs) in MENA*, and CDO Jordan, have worked closely
with our SIGINT Liaison Officer in Amman and the Language Advisory Committee to facilitate
this training. FAOs and CDO also provided detailed guidance to the students concerning NSA's
third party relationship with Jordan and their behavior while in a Muslim country. Once they
return, the students are expected to give detailed feedback to FAD.
