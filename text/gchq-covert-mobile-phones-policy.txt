1.	POLICY STATEMENT

1.1	Introduction

1.1.1	This policy defines the use of mobile phones by Tryst Travellers deployed
overseas. It has been agreed between OPA-TAS and PISECGIAS and is to
be read by all officers prior to deployment overseas.

1.1.2	It is OPA-TAS policy for officers to adopt best practice in the use of covert
mobile phones when deployed overseas in order to ensure both their own
personal security and GCHQ’s operational security. This policy dictates the
use of FCO provided non-attributable official and personal mobile phones by
officers while on deployment.

2.	Operating Rules

1.1.3	Official mobile phones are accountable items and must be signed for when
taken from the OPA-TAS secure store.

1.1.4	The mobile phones and the accessories must be returned to OPA-TAS on
return to the UK. Failure to do so may preclude future travel.

1.1.5	Official phones are to be used only for official business in country and
MUST not be used to make personal calls to the UK. If a call is unavoidable
then only out of area numbers can be called, these are:

•	GSOC TRYST OOA - 0207^^^^

•	TAS TRYST OOA - 0207 |

1.1.6	To avoid compromise the following must be adhered to:

•	The covert mobile phones are equipped with BLUETOOTH and therefore
they MUST not be switched on or used within a 50-mile radius of
Cheltenham and within this radius the battery must be removed from the
phone.

•	The covert mobile phone MUST NOT be recharged at the officer’s home
address or at temporary residence e.g. a hotel room, if it is within the 50
miles radius. If a phone needs to be charged then it is acceptable to do
so either at the airport or at your destination.

•	All contact with GCHQ should be via the OUT OF AREA numbers listed
above.

• Calls are not allowed between a covert mobile phone and a family or
friends home or mobile phone registered to an address within 50 miles of
Cheltenham

•	If you are carrying a covert mobile phone, you MUST NOT carry any
personal communications device e.g. mobile phone, ipad, notebooks,
PDAs, laptops etc.

•	Calls between covert mobiles are permissible provided both are more
than 50 miles from Cheltenham.

•	If you believe the phone to have been compromised, stop using it and
report the incident to TAS staff as soon as possible i.e. on return to the
UK.

3.	Procedures

1.1.7	The procedures for the storage and issue of the cover mobile phones are
contained in Reference C.

4.	Welfare

1.1.8	It is recognised that officers who are departing from, or have recently arrived
in the UK may wish to advise family or friends of disruption to their travel
plans. In such cases the officer must use payphones that are available in
the airport. If a phone is not available at the airport, then during office hours
contact the OPA-TAS OOA number, who will pass on the message onto the
family member.
