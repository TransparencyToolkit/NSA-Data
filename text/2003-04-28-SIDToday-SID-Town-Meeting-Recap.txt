After introducing<br>themselves and the other members of the SID Leadership Team, they went on to provide their<br>sense of where SID is headed. Several themes ran throughout the meeting:<br>(U) SID on the Right Path<br>(U//FOUO) MG Quirk and Mr. Meals emphasized that SID's current transformation efforts will<br>continue. They expected no major changes in direction or reorganizations. As General Quirk<br>stated, "The plane is rebuilt--let's fly it." SID's strategy remains the same, and is aligned with<br>the NSA strategy.<br>(U) The Importance of the Workforce<br>(U//FOUO) Both leaders hold the view that "people are the top and bottom line" in SID's<br>success. Mr. Meals described the workforce as brilliant and enthusiastic about their jobs. General<br>Quirk's view is that people want to: do good; make a difference; and reach their full potential. As<br>a manager, he wants to help people accomplish these goals.<br>(U//FOUO) In this vein, General Quirk and Mr. Meals will pay close attention to career<br>development issues, a fair promotion system, rewards for outstanding performance, and working<br>conditions. They also encouraged the workforce to achieve a proper work/life balance, and to<br>take leave as appropriate. General Quirk stated that he wants everyone to be "at their best"<br>when they are at work.<br>(U) Integration/Teamwork<br>(U//FOUO) SID has made great strides during this "Year of Integration", and these efforts will<br>continue. Our strategy for the Iraq Campaign--with its use of an OPPLAN, Issue Managers, and<br>other steps to ensure coordinated teamwork--worked "extremely well." There is more work to be<br>done, but we will continue to build on our successes in this regard. It is important that we all<br>pull together every day, and not only during crisis situations.<br>(U//FOUO) Regarding teamwork at the management level, General Quirk and Mr. Meals will<br>work very closely with each other and with the other members of SID leadership. This includes<br>the new leaders of the Deputy Directorates (see a recent SID Today article on the subject) and<br>the DD's Technical Directors.<br>(U) Values<br>(U) General Quirk reaffirmed that integrity and "doing the right thing" are values that we<br>continue to live by and describe "who we are."<br>(U) Leadership Style<br>(U) The SID leaders are serious about their work, but not about themselves. They believe that<br>we can enjoy ourselves while working hard.<br>(U//FOUO) MG Quirk and Charlie Meals would like to hear your ideas and concerns. They will try<br>to meet as many SID employees as possible in person.
