(S//SI) HPCP Conference Aids Collaboration

(S//SI) The Worldwide High Power Cordless Phone (HPCP) Conference, which took place from 27
to 31 October 2003 in the R&E; Symposium, was a resounding success. The intent of the
conference "HPCP Challenge: Team Effort" was not to solve all the issues within a week, but to
create a forum for all the active participants to establish networks, collaborate, plan future
dialogues and reduce or eliminate duplicative efforts, so that all the right people Community-
wide would be engaged in prosecuting this new technology smartly.

(S//SI) MG Richard Quirk opened the conference by charging the participants to view HPCP
exploitation as a "significant challenge, but a significant opportunity." He suggested that
methodologies established to exploit HPCP could be used as a template to tackle other tough
targets in the 21st century. Mr. Charlie Allen, Assistant DCI for Collection, then emphasized the
need for strong collaboration within and outside the SIGINT Community to combat this real-
world threat. He stressed the need "to work as a team because our adversaries are working as
one," noting that "America is now in a real struggle against a small, elusive and very very
dangerous enemy....Being able to collect communication devices such as HPCP phones can
literally spell the difference between life and death...life for us, death for would-be terrorists."

(S//SI) The conference was sponsored by	Chief, SIGDEV Strategy and Governance

and hosted by the Meade Operations Center's HPCP Analysis Cell (HAC). Conference registration
exceeded 500 personnel to include representatives from all the Second Party partners, each of
the U.S. armed services, and numerous contractors, as well as members from across the entire
Intelligence Community. To accommodate the participation of over 200 personnel from outside
NSAW and ensure maximum participation by all, NSAW personnel were encouraged to view the
conference either through NewsMagazine in their offices or at designated viewing areas within
the MOC.

(S//SI) The success of the conference can be directly attributed to the hard work of the HPCP
Conference Committee, headed by MOC Technical Director, Mr. Phil Cartun. His goal was to
provide briefings on as many aspects of HPCP as possible, from collection to reverse
engineering. In addition, he was successful in acquiring some nontraditional briefs, such as the
FCC (Federal Communications Commission) briefing on the use of SENAO in the United States,
and the National Ground Intelligence Center's (NGIC) involvement in exploiting improvised
explosive devices (IEDs). As a result of the sidebar discussions, numerous issues were identified
for the HAC to address in the coming weeks. These issues and their status, along with copies of
the briefs and a list of the conference attendees, are posted on the HAC homepage or type "go
hac."
