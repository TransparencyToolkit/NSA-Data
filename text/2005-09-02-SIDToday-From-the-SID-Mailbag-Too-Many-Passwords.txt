Question: (U//FOUO) Is there a unified effort to make it easier for all of the people working in
SID to manage accounts? I have over 30 accounts for everything from AIRGAP to my UNIX
logon which is different from my WINDOWS logon. The situation would be comical if it weren't so
ridiculously bothersome. I have to change 1/3 of my passwords every 60 days, another 1/3
every 90 days, and the last 1/3 stays the same forever. Each password has different
requirements so trying to keep them straight (without writing them down) is nearly impossible.
(U//FOUO) I know there are systems like Passport and PKI which can be widely used to access
multiple accounts. As more and more accounts pop up into our tool boxes as SID workers are
there efforts to consolidate accounts and passwords through programs like Passport and PKI
certification? (Please say "yes.")
Answer: (U) Yes!
(U//FOUO) According to X7 (ITD Architecture and Development), there is a unified effort to
minimize the number of username/password combinations a user must remember. New
applications such as CASPORT (see Question 356 ), combined with modernization of the network
infrastructure, Active Directory, will leverage each other to ultimately reduce the number of login
accounts for each user. These services will be specific for each network; account information will
not be passed across network security boundaries. Leveraging of services will also help to
address the password change problem.
