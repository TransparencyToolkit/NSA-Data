(U//FOUO) The Real Scoop on USSID SP0018 Briefings
FROM: 
SID Oversight and Compliance (SV)
Run Date: 11/03/2005

(U//FOUO) It's easier to get a briefing on USSID SP0018 ("Legal Compliance and Minimization
Procedures" -- formerly USSID 18) than you may think...
(U//FOUO) SID Oversight and Compliance and the NSA Office of the General Counsel brief about
4,000 people every year, all around the world, on USSID SP0018 and raw traffic database
usage. This year, we've reached that number already and with under two months to go, we're
well on our way to exceeding 5,000. That's 5,000 analysts, linguists, collectors, and other
professionals who are now trained for access to legally sensitive SIGINT data that they were
unable to access before.
(C) Many of you may have heard that USSID SP0018 briefings are only given once a month and
if you miss it, you have to wait another month. In the last five years, "live" briefings -interactive briefings involving NSA attorneys and members of the Oversight and Compliance staff
-- have been given at least twice a month and there are routinely a number of scheduled videoteleconferences (VTC) with one or more field sites, partner agencies, or deployed elements. In
an average month, there can be as many as eight or ten USSID SP0018 briefings to
facilitate data access.
(U//FOUO) Additionally, there are emergency provisions that can satisfy your briefing
requirement quickly via an on-line interim briefing available from the Oversight and Compliance
web page. The interim briefing will enable you to get your access for that short-fused operation
and get you scheduled for the next available interactive USSID SP0018 briefing given in-house.
We can also squeeze you into the audience for a VTC, if need be. If you need access, a USSID
SP0018 briefing is rarely an impediment, with so many options available.
(U//FOUO) If you haven't visited the SID Oversight and Compliance homepage lately, there
have been many changes and there are many more on the way. Useful information, automation,
and easier-to-follow links will help you get the information you need, get scheduled for a
briefing, watch the interim briefing, or track down useful information concerning collection,
reporting, dissemination, retention, FISA, IG quarterly reporting, Intelligence Oversight training,
and a lot more. To visit us, type "go sdv" or "go oversight" on the web.
