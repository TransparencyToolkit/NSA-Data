(TS//SI) Here's some feedback on the recent article on new access to an Indian net :
From:

, ITIS Senior Technical Advisor

Comment: (S//SI) The relevance [of this article] for me is that our office (ITIS) is responsible
for obtaining Joint Staff/CINC tier approvals for DSCS [Defense Satellite Communications
System] comms between INDRA and Hawaii. This kind of result, when presented to these senior
reps who approve our comms requirements, help justify current and future comms needs...
Excellent example of what NSA is doing with the comms at INDRA, in particular a recent 2Mbs
comms link expansion to handle these types of increased mission needs... Thanks.
