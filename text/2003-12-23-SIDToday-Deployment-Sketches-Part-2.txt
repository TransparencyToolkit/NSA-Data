And the back<br>seats aren't meant for people with long legs.<br>There are those in the SIGINT/Intell community who don't know<br>what NSA is, or what we do. And those people are either scary in<br>their ignorance, or excited in their innocence.<br> <br>In what used to be the Sherezade Bar in the Al Rasheed Hotel<br>There's no such thing as "a dry heat." Hot is hot!<br>Army chow halls will call boiled beef, carrots, and cabbage "stew"<br>if it is served with potatoes, but "stir fry" if they serve it with rice.<br>I can only stay awake for 48 hours before I shut down.<br>Somehow, I never got the coveted Hamburger Patty MRE. I think<br>I ate maybe 50 MRE's, but not once did I get the hamburger.<br>When they say the tent sleeps 10, they are lying. We had 8 cots<br>in there, and two guys were hot-racking, and we still had to go<br>outside to change our minds.<br>Clean is a relative term - Gunny was right. All I could get was<br>clean-er, but I was never clean...<br>It's easier to leave than be left behind. Working 12+ hour days<br>(or night shift), in a combat situation, there's no extra time to<br>think - you shower (if possible), eat, go to work, and sleep. That's<br>it. I didn't have the luxury of a lot of free time to think about my<br>family. (On the upside, I was able to talk to my husband who<br>works here via the NSTS, and email him, as well.)<br>The Army burns everything - trash, latrines, everything. I have<br>never been so glad to be an NCO (non-commissioned officer) with<br>NSA, as we were not required to perform a particularly nasty<br>detail. Porta-johns were a luxury.<br>When you set up a tent, and shower, make sure you don't put it<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

Dispatch from CSG<br>Baghdad<br><br> </p>next to a heli-pad. The rotor wash will knock over your shower, and<br>the dust gets all over your stuff.<br>When evicting sheep from your living spaces, you must make<br>sure they have somewhere else to go, or they'll keep coming back.<br>And back, and back.<br>It rains mud in Baghdad... The dust is so fine, that by the time<br>rain hits the ground, it is mud.<br>The Quartermaster can make your uniform so wrinkly and small,<br>that it is easier to wash it in a bucket. Also, they can turn white<br>clothes a variety of colors: gray, green, black, and brown!<br>Pringles rarely survive the mail. And a bar of Irish Spring soap<br>will make every thing in the box taste like it.<br>(U//FOUO) Would I do it again? Absolutely! This is what I'm<br>supposed to do - I'm in the military... we kill people, and blow<br>things up. It's our job. It's my job to make sure that the people<br>doing the overall mission do it with the best intelligence in the<br>world. And NSA has it. I owe a big thanks to all of the people who<br>produced the intelligence so we could support V Corps, and I owe a<br>big thanks to my team who kept me safe, to the GEOCELL who<br>gave me the training and opportunity to use it, and to my husband<br>who I knew would take such good care of the boys that I never had<br>to worry about them, and could concentrate on the job.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
