(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development's Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) invites you to a
festive open house! Come one, come all! Learn about how the T3C researches what top targets
are doing with technology. See the creative ways we let our customers know what may be
coming in the future. Learn about how tools are being developed to automate some of these
research processes. Fun, games, and friendly conversation await you in OPS1 2E136 on 17
March, 1000-1400.
(U//FOUO) If you took the SIGINT Development's Target Technology Trends Center (T3C)
survey now's the time to find out what it means. The T3C identified fourteen important
technologies coupled with target evidence that impact SIGINT and are driving SID's strategic
planning and out year budget decisions. Learn what these technologies are, who uses them, and
why they are important to you. Do you agree with the list? Do you want to learn more? Do you
want your voice heard for this year's survey?
(S//SI) Does China or Iran interest you? What about satellites, optical fiber, convergence, or
wireless technologies? T3C just completed four Technology Placemats that also highlight target
use. Be the first in your office to see these!
