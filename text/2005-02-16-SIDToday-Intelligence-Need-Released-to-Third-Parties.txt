(U//FOUO) Intelligence Need Released to Third Parties
FROM: 
formerly of FAD's SID Operations Group (DP1)
Run Date: 02/16/2005

IN for Iraqi Elections was the first ever to be released to Third Parties (S//SI)
(S//SI) NSA recently set a precedent when it sanitized and released an intelligence need (IN) to
Third Party partners on the January elections in Iraq. On 4 January, the IN was released to
Second and Third Party partners of the SIGINT Seniors CT (SISECT) Coalition, soliciting their
assistance in monitoring the important and volatile event. (SISECT comprises partners from
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
UK, and US.) By 18 January, Italy produced a lengthy assessment in response to the IN. Other
nations have pledged to remain watchful and share with us any information responding to the
Essential Elements of Information in the IN.
(U) Given the immediacy of the need, FAD's forward-deployed personnel facilitated collaboration
between elements in SID's Customer Relationships (S1) and Analysis & Production (S2)
Directorates. Customer Gateway (S11) also coordinated with the originator of the IN,
USCENTCOM, to ensure that its equities were protected.
