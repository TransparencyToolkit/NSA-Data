(U//FOUO) What's Happening at NSA/CSS Georgia
FROM: 
D/Chief of Staff, Directorate of Operations, NSA/CSS Georgia
Run Date: 11/09/2005

(U//FOUO) SIDtoday is pleased to present its first "what's happening" article from Fort Gordon:
(S//SI) The end of FY 05 and beginning of FY 06 has been a particularly busy and exciting time
for NSA/CSS Georgia as we continue our SIGINT support to the Global War on Terrorism in a
high intensity AOR*. Many NSA-G accomplishments have been briefed at the Director's weekly
Campaign Update, in Director's desk notes to DOD and Intelligence Community seniors and in
feedback from our customers, especially those forces deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Additionally, we have hosted both the Director and Deputy Director of NSA, continued detailed
planning on mission alignment and transformation as well as planning for our new building
construction.
(S//SI) We have also successfully stood up the Alternate- NSOC (Project DECKPIN) and
integrated a NSAW team into the Alt-NSOC rotation. We have begun some new missions and
expanded existing ones. Below are just three operational features that aim toward the
successful continuation of our vitality in the SIGINT operations arena.
(TS//SI) The NSAG S2E Iranian shop hosted the 3rd Annual Iranian Target Development
conference at Fort Gordon from 4 - 6 October. This event was instrumental in providing a
forum for ground-level exchange of SIGINT efforts to improve the intelligence production on an
elusive target set. Over 50 external guests, including Second Party partners, and NSA/CSS
Georgia analysts compared notes on the task of exploiting Iranian communications as the
Iranian's utilize indigenous encryption and move into high technology methods of performing
command-and-control. The outcome of this conference was a comprehensive understanding of
the enterprise's SIGINT efforts and the virtual teaming necessary to continue viable prosecution
of this target set.
(U//FOUO) Tangible production from NSAG's new mission growth areas has begun, most
notably:
Counternarcotics (CN)
(S//SI) DEA* recently inserted Forward Area Support Teams into Afghanistan to conduct CN
operations in conjunction with the Afghan National Interdiction Unit, a branch of the CounterNarcotics Police of Afghanistan. NSA forward-deployed elements, the NSAG team, and the S2F11
SWAN Team collaborated very closely in supporting operations in Nangarhar Province.
(S//SI) During the planning process, HUMINT from DEA and CIA, along with extensive imagery
from NGA* were utilized in order to assure as comprehensive a targeting package as possible.
Imagery and HUMINT targets were verified and re-verified by SIGINT right up until the DEA
team's insertion into the target area. During the conduct of the raid, SIGINT elements located at
NSAW, NSAG, and CFC-A (Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan) were on station to guide
and provide threat warning as the operation unfolded. Personnel at NSAG monitored VHF/UHF
communications from a CENTCOM Predator [unmanned aerial vehicle] brought in to support the
operation, and provided gists of intercept derived from high-interest VOICESAIL handsets that
were active during the raid.

(S//SI) As a result of this collaborative effort, the operation was a resounding success with

 five major heroin labs and over a ton of opiates and precursor chemicals destroyed,
and valuable intelligence recovered that will be utilized in keying future operations. DEA has
expressed its deepest gratitude to the SIGINT community for its support and direction during
this initial operation and will utilize the precedents set here as a model and standard for future
operations. NSAG released their first CN serialized end-product on this event; the product
recapped the drug smugglers actions prior to and during the DEA raid.
Combating Proliferation (CP)
(S//SI) NSA/CSS Georgia's CP mission commenced operations on 1 April 2005. Since then, this
production center (8 personnel so far) has completed Product Phasing on the Advanced
Conventional Weapons mission and is mid-way through phasing on the High Interest Cargoes
and CBRN missions. As of October, CP Georgia/S2X3, with guidance and assistance from S2G
and NSA Georgia's reporting staffs, has been engaged in mission transfer and follow-on target
development and processing resulting in over 40 product reports with accolades received from a
variety of customers. CP Georgia is attracting many talented SIGINT professionals and will
quickly become a center of excellence within the Global Net-centric Cryptologic Community.
