Today, another<br>50 workstations are available for additional TTIC personnel in the adjoining space. TTIC is<br>staffed with officers from CIA, FBI, DHS (Dept. of Homeland Security), DIA, State, NSA, DOE<br>(Dept. of Energy), Capitol Police, NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), and the NRC<br>(Nuclear Regulatory Commission).<br>(U) A couple of developments of interest to SID:<br>(C) The TTIC Director, as the successor to the ADCI (Assistant Director of Central Intelligence)<br>for Homeland Security, became the DCI's responsible official for Information Sharing. The other<br>officials responsible for information sharing are Maureen Baginski, the FBI's Executive Assistant<br>Director of Intelligence, and General Frank Libutti, the Department of Homeland Security's Under<br>Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. These three officials<br>have agreed to establish a Program Office within TTIC to ensure implementation of an MOU<br>(Memorandum of Understanding) on Information Sharing. The TTIC's Information Sharing<br>Program Office will be responsible for determining the universe of terrorist-related information<br>that is available within all of the TTIC's component organizations and ensure compliance with the<br>letter and spirit of the Information Sharing MOU.<br>(C) The DCI has asked the former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Dick Kerr, to head an<br>independent and objective group called the Kerr Commission that will assess the current<br>allocation of responsibilities and make recommendations to the DCI about TTIC's appropriate<br>mission. This is related to the analysis and production of finished intelligence on international<br>terrorism. This review is necessary to shape appropriately the ultimate mission of TTIC and to<br>determine what analytic resources, personnel, and mission responsibilities currently dispersed<br>throughout the Intelligence Community should be migrated to TTIC.<br>(U) TTIC held a kick-off event on 9 July at the construction site of the new Hazel-Peterson (HP)<br>building in McLean. Initial TTIC occupancy is still on schedule for May 2004. TTIC is still in the<br>development stage, but much progress has already been made-- watch for future updates!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
