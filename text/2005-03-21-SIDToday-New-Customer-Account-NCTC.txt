(U) New Customer Account: NCTC
FROM: 
Account Manager for NCTC (S112)
Run Date: 03/21/2005

(U//FOUO) SID's Customer Relations Directorate (CRD) has added a new account to its nationallevel customer base: the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). This is only the second
customer account to be added since CRD's inception four years ago. The NCTC, which was
established by Presidential Executive Order (EO) 13354 in August 2004, formally came into
existence on 6 December 2004. The NCTC has absorbed its predecessor organization, the
Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC), with the TTIC name now obsolete. The Center will
have an expanded mission over that of TTIC; however, many details remain to be worked out.
(U//FOUO) Designated as a permanent National Intelligence Center, the NCTC will report to the
Director of National Intelligence (whereas the TTIC reported to the old position of Director of
Central Intelligence) and will serve as the U.S. government focal point for:
Conducting strategic/operational planning for counterterrorism (CT) activities;
Identifying/coordinating/prioritizing CT Requirements;
Analyzing and integrating all intelligence pertaining to terrorism/CT;
Establishing the information technology systems/architectures for CT information
sharing;
Serving as a central and shared knowledge bank on terrorism information.
(U//FOUO) Former NSA Representative to TTIC 
 is the SID Account Manager for
this new customer, and a Senior Executive Account Manager will soon be named. Although not a
CIA organization, NCTC falls within NCR CIA Francine Forney's portfolio. Among the growing
NSA contingent at the NCTC is former CT Product Line Chief Bill Gaches, who heads the NCTC
Analysis and Production Department, and current NSA Liaison Officer
(U//FOUO) If you would like to find out more about the NCTC, there will be an information
session on 15 April from 0830-1130 in 9A135/Headquarters Building. Contact 
 on 
 or via E-mail at
 if you are interested in attending this
session or in learning more about the NCTC. In addition, information about the NCTC will soon
posted on the F5 Website .
