Annual intelligence oversight training (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) The right to privacy is one of the fundamental privileges of all Americans. A number
of legal and policy documents have been put in place to guarantee that government agencies,
including NSA, protect these rights in the course of their duties. Today I remind you that once a
year, every NSA employee -- without exception -- must take some time to review those
documents that govern our activities. I will also tell you how you can conveniently meet this
annual requirement for intelligence oversight training.
(U//FOUO) It is important that all SID employees (including civilians, military, contractors and
integrees) understand the authority under which we carry out the NSA mission as well as the
Fourth Amendment-derived restrictions placed upon the execution of the mission. Reviewing the
below documents on an annual basis fulfills the minimum oversight training in SID:
The primary document governing NSA's intelligence activities is Executive Order 12333.
In addition, NSA employees are subject to DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and NSA Policy 123, both of which implement the Executive Order.
For SID employees, USSID 18 provides the SIGINT minimization procedures required by
these documents and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
Finally, NSCID 6 defines SIGINT and prescribes the conduct of SIGINT activities.
(U//FOUO) You can access these documents and register your compliance at the following
website:
(U//FOUO) All SID employees are required to review these documents by the end of the
fiscal year, 30 September 2005. For more information on this intelligence oversight training,
see the companion SID today article by
 SID's Senior Oversight Executive.
(U//FOUO) If you come across any questionable intelligence activities, report them to the NSA
Office of Inspector General, the Office of General Counsel, and SID Oversight and Compliance.
