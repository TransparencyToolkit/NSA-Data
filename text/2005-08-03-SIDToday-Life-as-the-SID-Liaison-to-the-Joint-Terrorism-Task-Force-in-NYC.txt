(U//FOUO) Life as the SID Liaison to the Joint Terrorism Task Force
in NYC
FROM: 
NSA/SID Representative to the JTTF (S112)
Run Date: 08/03/2005
(C) I am the first NSA/SID representative to a Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF), the JTTF in the
FBI New York Field Office (NYO). I'm sure my experiences are not uncommon but because
they're in New York City, they are unique. Everything imaginable happens here, and very often it
has a terrorism nexus. The JTTF, composed of almost 400 people from 37 different federal,
state, and local agencies, is involved in all events related to terrorism.

(S) The JTTF is totally integrated and almost all are cleared for SIGINT and HUMINT. Being
integrated allows me to "live in the customers' spaces" and facilitates the exchange of
information. As result, I am better able to relate to the needs and requirements of each member
of the JTTF. We JTTF members all bring different skills and resources and we all work together
to get the job done.
(S) The Chief of the JTTF NY also carries the title of "Special Agent in Charge of the
Counterterrorism Division (CTD) in FBI NYO." The CTD and JTTF are one and the same and are
used interchangeably in the NYO. It has three branches: Branch A with a mainly foreign
terrorism focus, Branch B with a mainly domestic terrorism focus, and the Office of Intelligence
(Note: Although called an office, it is considered a branch). I am assigned to the latter, but I am
called upon to work with any JTTF member.
(S) NSA supports some long-standing cases, such as the East Africa Embassy Bombings, the
World Trade Center Bombings (I & II), the USS Cole bombing, and TERRstop (a plot to bomb
NYC landmarks). All these cases still have fugitives on the loose throughout the world. NSA
reporting provides key lead information to assist in the apprehension of these fugitives. And
there are newer cases also, such as the prevention of potential future terrorist events, or events
where U.S. people have been killed and/or injured, such as the Madrid bombing on March 11,
2004 (referred to as 3/11).
(TS//SI) A case that was recently in the news serves as a good example of the difference NSA
can make. It involved a sheikh (a senior official) of the al-Islah Party who was accused of giving
financial support to terrorist groups, including Al-Qa'ida and Hamas. The sheikh was recently on
trial in NYC... In fact, I know and have worked with the FBI NYO Special Agent and an
Intelligence Analyst who testified in the case. Although this fact is unknown to the general
public, and to the vast majority of the law enforcement community, NSA reporting played a key
role in bringing the sheikh to trial.
(TS//SI) Sometimes the successes are more modest. Thanks to the NSA-provided equipment,
which includes a gray phone, JTTF members are able to easily and securely interact with their
NSA counterparts--no small feat in many geographic areas. This interaction with members of
the JTTF is the "name of the game" in order to anticipate and act on their information needs.
This makes a difference in the global war on terrorism at the FBI NYO.
(C) These impacts would not be possible without the human element, namely an actual person
deployed up here in NYC and I am happy to be that person. I give of my expertise and skills,
acquired from being an Intelligence Analyst for 24 years, and in return I get to see firsthand the
difference NSA can make. Although I am the first NSA/SID representative to the JTTF NY, I am
not the first NSA representative to be deployed to the FBI's NY Field Office. But that is a story
for another person and another time....
