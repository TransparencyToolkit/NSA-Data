(C) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce the 2005
SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Conference. This annual event provides the opportunity for
SIGDEV experts from across the 5-Eyes community to share discovery efforts and uncover
potential solutions to the toughest SIGDEV challenges.
(U) It is also a great opportunity to network with your colleagues and learn about the latest
tools and techniques. As always, we'll be looking to identify the next steps needed to improve
our worldwide collaboration efforts.
(U//FOUO) This year's conference will be held during the week of 6-10 June here at NSA. All
sessions will be held at the TS//SI level.
(U//FOUO) The theme for the 2005 SIGINT Development Conference is 'Converging
Technologies...Discovering Solutions." The conference will open with a keynote address by Mr.
William Black, Deputy Director, NSA/CSS in the Friedman Auditorium at 0900 on Monday, 6
June, followed by a joint presentation by SIGDEV leaders from NSA, DSD, CSE, GCHQ and GCSB.
(U//FOUO) Conference registration begins on 25 April. A volunteer sign-up is now available on
line. We are currently accepting abstracts through 18 April. Workshops this year will focus on
discussions rather than PowerPoint presentations. We will also consider presentation topics
outside of the main threads, scheduling them as sidebar sessions throughout the week. The
major threads for the conference are:
ASR: Building a Globally Distributed Coordinated 5-Eyes SIGINT Analysis Capability
Innovative approaches to SIGINT Development
Linking Target to Network to Environment: Connecting the Dots
SIGINT Development Support to Military Operations
Skills Development collaboration: Shaping the SIGINT Development workforce

TS//SI level, so mark your calendars and start making plans to attend. Contractors are welcome
but they must be currently performing SIGINT Development work.
