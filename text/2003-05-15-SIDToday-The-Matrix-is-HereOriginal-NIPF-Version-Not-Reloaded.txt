To refresh you, NIPF is the new National Intelligence Priorities Framework, which<br>completely overhauls the intelligence priority process. NIPF is the response to a Presidential<br>Directive and is a more dynamic process than ones in the past. It includes a priorities review<br>every six months and comprises a basic matrix --a prioritized list of intelligence topics that<br>encompass the breadth of the Intelligence Community missions plotted against a global set of<br>target countries and organizations.<br>(C) The NIPF matrix has been approved by the DDCI for Community Management, Joan<br>Dempsey, and the ADCI for Analysis and Production, Mark Lowenthal for community release. The<br>NIPF matrix, together with the DCI priorities defined in NSPD-26, will be posted on the new<br>ADCI/AP NIPF website on Intelink. Information on specific Intelink websites on which NIPF and<br>NSPD-26 data are posted is listed below. In addition, the files and documents may be accessed<br>on the Strategic Intelligence Issues website ("go S17")<br>(C) The Intelink version is available at <br><br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
