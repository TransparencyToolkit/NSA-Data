(U) November 11th: A Day Dedicated to Peace
FROM: CW4

SIGINT Director's Military Cryptologic Advisor
Run Date: 11/10/2005

In 1954, President Eisenhower signed a bill proclaiming November 11th as Veterans Day. He call
for Americans everywhere to rededicate themselves to the cause of peace. In America, this
holiday has had a long history of dedication to peace. Originally, the holiday universally
recognized the celebrated ending of the World War I hostilities at 11 a. m., November 11, 1918
(the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month).
Today we thank all the men and women who have served in our military service to ensure that
we have the opportunity -and the privilege - to live in a peaceful land. Nearly 30 million
Americans have served or are currently serving around the globe in he Active, Guard and
Reserves components protecting our nation.
Likewise, we should not forget our strongest allies who have stood by us in this Global War on
Terrorism and other such conflicts: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. As
we do during Memorial Day, on November 11th they will celebrate Remembrance Day to honor
their service members who have given the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.
Please join me in honoring all veterans today. They are all around us. They are your
grandfathers, your grandmothers, your father, your mother, uncles, aunts, your sons and
daughters. And they might even be the guy or gal sitting in the next cubicle!
