(S//SI) Hungarian MIO Reporting Initiative to Serve as Model
FROM: 
FAD's Central/Eastern Europe Office (DP13)
Run Date: 03/04/2005

Hungarian SIGINT'ers invited to write reports for dissemination through NSA (S//SI)
(S//SI) During his recent visit to Hungary, the Assistant Director of Foreign Affairs for SID
Operations, 
, delivered a letter from NSA's SIGINT Director to the Director-General
of the Hungarian Military Intelligence Office (MIO). This letter praised the quality of MIO analysis
and reporting and invited the MIO to work with NSA as part of our extended SIGINT
enterprise. With a goal of equipping MIO analysts to write SIGINT reports for dissemination
through the NSA system to our Intelligence Community customers, the SIGINT Director offered
reporting seminars to our Hungarian partner.
(S//SI) Over the past 18 months, two tailored reporting courses have been conducted for MIO,
in order to familiarize MIO with NSA's reporting style and how it is driven by our customers'
Intelligence Needs. Based on considerable strides in MIO reporting after those courses, an
intermediate-level course on NSA reporting format will be conducted this month.
(S//SI) In addition to providing unique access to Serbian and Ukrainian military targets, MIO has
been instrumental in providing intelligence that answers high-priority CIA and DIA requirements
that NSA would otherwise not be able to answer due to manpower constraints. Engaging foreign
partners on initiatives such as this will leverage our partners' language, target, and analytic
expertise to help fill some of the gaps left by personnel reassignments and mission reductions.
