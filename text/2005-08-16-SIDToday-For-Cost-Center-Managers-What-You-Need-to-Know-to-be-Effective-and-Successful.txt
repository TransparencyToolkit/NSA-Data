and Successful
FROM: David Zlowe
Chief, SIGINT Planning, Programming and Performance (S01X)
Run Date: 08/16/2005
(U//FOUO) Are you one of the 165 SID Cost Center Managers (CCM)? If so, you are responsible
for several millions of dollars and other resources expended to achieve NSA corporate and SID
objectives.
(U//FOUO) CCMs routinely face a myriad of challenges, balancing conflicting priorities, locating
and accessing data to accurately determine portfolio performance and financial status; ensuring
outlays and obligation rates are achieved, and meeting schedule, performance, and budget
requirements. Both new and existing Cost Center Managers need to know the questions to ask
and where to go for support to accomplish their business objectives. To assist in meeting the
daily challenges of Cost Center Management, help is on the way.
(U//FOUO) The SID Chief of Staff has commissioned the development of a focused effort to
support CC Managers. For example, a Cost Center Manager Advisory Committee composed of
current and former CCMs and Resource Management Experts has been established to guide and
mentor CCMs in the execution of their responsibilities.
(U) WHAT CCM'S SHOULD DO NOW:
(U//FOUO) Cost Center Managers can access the CCM Checklist . The Checklist provides detailed
information on what you need to know, as well as links to information and resources needed in
your role as a CCM.
(U//FOUO) Share your thoughts! To comment or to find out more about available support, type "
Go PMF " or visit the S01X webpage for additional information. Look forward to more information
on this topic in the months to come.
