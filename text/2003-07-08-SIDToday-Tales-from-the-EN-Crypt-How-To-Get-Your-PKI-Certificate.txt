(How To Get Your PKI<br>Certificate)<br>FROM:<br>Chief, Support Requirements<br>Run Date: 07/08/2003<br>(U//FOUO) Some of you have heard the buzz over the past several months about PKI<br>certificates. The clock is ticking and everyone is on an end-of-the-year deadline! But what are<br>these mysterious certificates? Who needs them? How do we get them? AND WHY?!?! The<br>following paragraphs will answer these questions and offer a few secrets on how to get certified<br>as quickly and as painlessly as possible! Don't wait until October--this requirement is not going<br>to go away, so get it out of your way now!!!<br>(U//FOUO) First, what is a PKI certificate? PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. The PKI<br>system is a comprehensive encryption system that protects information against unauthorized<br>disclosure, unauthorized modifications through digital signing, unauthorized access by enabling<br>access controls and authorization services, and false user identifications.<br>(U//FOUO) Who needs them? Almost everyone! If you work at NSA and you are a US citizen<br>holding a blue, green, or gold badge, then YOU NEED ONE! So if you are a Second Party member<br>or a non-US citizen, then you have some breathing room, but the system will be ready for you<br>soon!<br>(U//FOUO) WHY do we need them? This is perhaps the most important question. The answer<br>is multi-fold. First, the current email encryption system, ICARUS, is going away. It will be out of<br>service and the PKI system is the replacement. In addition, the PKI certificate will soon be a<br>necessity in order to use CONCERTO, Peoplesoft, and other similar applications. So even if you<br>rarely send encrypted emails, you still need to get the certificate. Without it, your<br>individual access to certain information will be significantly limited.<br>(U//FOUO) Now you know what a PKI certificate is, who needs it, and why. So now you need to<br>know HOW TO GET IT! Here's how:<br>(U//FOUO) Take a deep breath. Accept that this will take a bit of your time, but it must be done,<br>so just dive in! Type "go pki" on the web. The PKI home page will appear and it will walk you<br>through a four-step process that will culminate in obtaining your certificate.<br>(U//FOUO) Warning! There are a few items in the process that can be confusing. Reading these<br>hints, in conjunction with the instructions on the home page, will guarantee some time saved:<br>1) Before you start, make sure that you have an active Searchlight account. If you do<br>not, you will need to get one before you can get the certificate.<br>2) When you get to the PKI Home Page, there are two seemingly good options: "Getting<br>your NTS-PKI Personal Certificate" and "Getting your NTS-PKI Server Certificate". Click<br>on "Getting your NTS-PKI Personal Certificate".<br>3) If you are a Second Party member, you cannot get a PKI Certificate yet.<br>4) In Step 2, the directions instruct you to check for your secondary SMTP address.<br>Your secondary SMTP address is the lowercase one. You will see SMTP and smtp; the<br>address that follows the smtp is your secondary address .<br>5) If you do not have either the security switch or the secondary SMTP address. Call<br>x<br> It's only takes a second for them to give you one. Really.<br>6) For Step 3, you might want to print the page so that you can follow the instructions as<br>you go along. Boxes start to pop up and it gets difficult to read the instructions and<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">follow them correctly.<br>7) In Step 3, if you enter your sid and it says that your Searchlight information does<br>not match your Concerto information , don't panic. Just send <br>@nsa a<br>short email that says your information does not match, and they will immediately fix it.<br>(Note: I had to call to get my secondary SMTP address and I had to send an email about<br>a Searchlight mismatch, and getting to STEP 4 still only took me about 15 minutes! It<br>just sounds worse than it is!)<br>8) Thursday morning is not a good time for getting your PKI. The server goes through<br>maintenance then, and the kiosks open late. It is possible to get your certificate in the<br>late morning on Thursdays, but another day is probably a better option, if possible.<br>9) Going to the kiosks. Ok, this involves a little bit of physical energy. Yes, you have to<br>leave your desk and go to the kiosk (room) closest to you. If (and only if) you have to<br>travel outside of the building, you must bring a courier bag with you. Please<br>expect the kiosk to take about 15 minutes. It takes a few minutes for the machine to<br>generate a password and to print it out. So don't get agitated, just expect a short wait.<br>10) VERY IMPORTANT! At the kiosk you will receive information on completing your PKI<br>certificate. You will return to your desk and follow a step-by-step package of instructions.<br>ONCE YOU BEGIN THIS PROCESS YOU SHOULD SET ASIDE ENOUGH TIME TO<br>COMPLETE THE WHOLE THING. It is much less confusing that way, and you avoid<br>getting sidetracked. There is a link that is only valid for same-day use , so once you<br>start, commit yourself to completing it. It will probably take you about 30 minutes to an<br>hour to complete this final step. BUT THEN YOU'RE FINISHED!<br>11) Final hint : Just accept that this process might be a little confusing, a little<br>frustrating, a little time-consuming, but just sit down, take a deep breath and do it! It<br>really isn't that bad!!!!<br>(U//FOUO) If you have any further questions, the PKI Help Desk (<br>any and all questions!<br><br>s) is available for<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
