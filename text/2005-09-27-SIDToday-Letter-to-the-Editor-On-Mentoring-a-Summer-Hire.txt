Comment: 
(U//FOUO) Just wanted to say that as a member of the OCMC Orbit Shop and a very long-time
member of the SIGINT team, it was a decided pleasure to work with and mentor a young vibrant
summer hire such as Ms. 
. I can honestly say it has been a rare moment in my life when I
was so impressed with a neophite's quick and accurate grasp of things highly technical and her
ability to use her knowledge in a productive way. As an "older" citizen, I can take heart in the
calibre of the youngsters coming into this vital work. Until I met Ms. 
 that was not
evident. A good summer for both of us.
