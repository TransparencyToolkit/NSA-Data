(U) Document Description

This document defines the FASHIONCLEFT Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)
collection protocol that enables raw data packets from the external Internet to interface to
the Common Data Receptor (CDR) of Data Network Technology?s Common
System Architecture (CSA). This interface will be deployed to support Tailored Access
Operations (TAO) On-Net operations, specifically implants that are required to exfiltrate
collected network packets, but due to implant processing and bandwidth constraints are
required to utilize a low overhead egress protocol.

This document defines the interface requirement that the Common Data Receptor
and implant must support to enable successful reception of raw data packets sent by the
implant. It includes conceptual data flow diagrams and network diagrams to define the
system. It also contains detailed data format examples, data field definitions, and a
description of the protocol.

(U) Background

The Common Data Receptor (CDR) is a DNT-designed system to perform the data
reception portion of what is commonly termed a ?Listening Post.? The CDR supports a
common interface that DNT developers use for data formatting and reception. In addition,
the Common Data Receptor concept emphasizes the use of a Data Receptor, Operations
Manager, and Network Manager vice a Listening Post.

(SliSl/le) The introduction of the FASHIONCLEFT protocol is necessary because without
the FASHIONCLEFT protocol, the implant-to-CDR communication previously did not
handle raw IP data packets. In addition, an implant previously had no way to deal with the
challenge of processing streaming data while minimizing the computing overhead
associated with encapsulating and the data. This new protocol provides the
developer a mechanism to specify the level of implemented in the implant as a
precursor to data transmission.

(SliSl/le) The FASHIONCLEFT protocol supports the passing of metadata securely and
with authentication.

(SliSl/le) The metadata is used to support the reconstruction of IP packets and when
applicable to convey information about the session.

and SEAGULLFARO In addition, a one-way transfer device ROOTKNOT
(composed of Pitcher, Catcher, and their one-way link) supplants the air gap previously
employed (that required manual transfer by diskette). In order to support this configuration,
DNT has been working closely with the Remote Operations Center (ROC) to design and
build FIGBUILD (an external mission network) and OPTICPINCH (an internal mission
network).

Figure 1.3-1 below shows the Common Data Receptor Architecture as described in
the referenced FLAXENPRECEPT EICDs.

The interfaces supported by the CDR must also support the separation of
classi?ed and unclassified processing. Classified information, such as egress data and
metadata must be protected while on the unclassified network side before passing through
the one-way link. This interface also supports the CDR protection of classified information.

Interface Description

This interface provides TAO developers a low overheard solution to exfiltrate
streaming data, typically associated with implants that collect raw packets from the target
environment, while providing the appropriate metadata and authentication. The basic
design principle behind this low overhead approach is to redirect a copy or clone of the
original packet to another host, or listening post (in this case the CDR). In-order to redirect
a packet, features of the copy of the packet must be altered particularly the source and
destination addresses, and possibly the port numbers.

Classification: Top Secret COMINT X1

This interface is designed to support the reception of "cloned" packets and their
associated metadata originating from implants, while supporting authentication of the
egress data and correlation of received packets to the appropriate metadata. To provide
greater flexibility for the implant, several configurable levels of are supported.

The following assumptions are made:

- This interface supports egress of data and does not support a command and
control channel.

- This interface is used by implants which for valid reasons are unable to implement
egress methods that require greater resources from the target, such as
encapsulation.

- Egress data must be associated with authenticated metadata.

- This interface may not be suitable for all boundary defenses that could be
encountered within a target environment. Extensibility has been designed to allow
additional packet selection algorithms to be added, such that future changes to skirt
other defenses can be readily included.

This interface implements four functions:

- Transmission of session announcements,

- Transmission of metadata,

- Transmission of data packets,

- Reconstruction of data packets using the metadata, and

- Reconstruction of sessions using metadata to track and collate data packets
belonging to a particular session.

During session establishment, an implant authenticates itself to the CDR and
requests the CDR to begin reception of data packets that belong to this session. As part of
establishing the session, metadata about the session is passed, along with metadata that
the CDR requires to assign data packets to the session and collate data packets within the
session. The session establishment function uses the FOGYNULL protocol family to
authenticate and securely pass metadata, packet collation information and data packet
status.

There are several methods that an implant could use to collate data packets to the
appropriate session, but only one method can be used in any session. The implant picks
the appropriate Exfil Type either "Packet" or ?Session,? and either ex?ltrates one
modified copy of a source packet per source packet, or assembles the source data
payloads from several source packets into one packet to be exfiltrated. The
FASHIONCLEFT interface design allows these methods to be extensible, so additional
methods can later be developed and included to meet operational constraints imposed by
boundary defenses.

The data packets are generally a copy of a packet that was collected, and had its
destination address changed to send it to the CDR. Additional fields might have been
altered to support one of the methods of assigning data packets to a session and collating
data within a session. If selected during the session establishment, the payload section of
the packet may be using the mode specified by the FASHIONCLEFT protocol
mode selection in the FOGYNULL implant header.

2. FASHIONCLEFT Protocol Details I

Metadata is used to announce the initiation of a session, to describe the
session, and to provide original packet reconstruction information.

 

From the point of view of an implant, a streaming data transmission session is
accomplished in two steps, first sending the session announcement metadata,
followed by the continuous sending of the streaming data packets.

2.1. FASHIONCLEFT Session Announcement

FASHIONCLEFT session announcement metadata announces the initiation of
a session, describes the session, and conveys data packet reconstruction (and
association) information to enable data packets and sessions to be reconstructed after
collection.

2.1.1. Session Announcement Description

FASHIONCLEFT adds two new fields in the FOGYNULL protocol
infrastructure header to proclaim that data packets containing streaming data are to be
sent using the FASHIONCLEFT protocol (Packet-IF-Selector, Packet-IF-Data); and
adds a new OpCode tag (0X09) plus new mode tags in the FOGYNULL
protocol implant header to indicate that raw packets will be exfiltrated and the extent to
which they are being 

FASHIONCLEFT also adds new tags in the SHELLGREY protocol that fully
characterize the original source and original destination of streaming data packets that
follow. In addition, FASHIONCLEFT uses the SHELLGREY metadata tag to
indicate whether the target data will be exfiltrated as:

a ?Packet data? (one exfil data packet per cloned target packet) or

a ?Session data? (each exfil data packet contains target data payload that may
have been captured prior to being encapsulated by the target source into
multiple packets for transmission)

The structure of session announcement is comprised of the FOGYNULL

Headers, both the Infrastructure and Implants headers; followed by SHELLGREY

Meta-data, format within a FUNNELAPS protocol with no data. All multi-byte fields in

the Infrastructure and Implant Headers are in network byte order big endian).
2.1.2. FOGYNULL Headers

2.1.2.1. Infrastructure Header

The purpose of the following three elements of the infrastructure header (version 2
and later of FOGYNULL) is to indicate the characteristics of the origination of the packet:

- Implant ID
a Target ID
- Deployment ID (allow different keys for same {ImplantID, TargetlD})

The purpose of the next two elements of the infrastructure header
(FASHIONCLEFT addition to FOGYNULL) is as follows:

- Packet Data (This new field uses the first 32 bytes of a formerly "random" field.)

The purpose of the new Packet Selector [0x0n] field is to allow selection of a
choice of algorithm that will collate the data to the sessions. The following three choices
are provided:

The details of these selections are further discussed in Section 3. Because the
choice values are extensible, it could be possible to add additional choices in the future.

Contents of the packet data field depend on the choice previously selected in
the Packet Selector field.

New modes and options for of data packets are added to the
FOGYNULL authentication protocol, as shown in Table 2.1.2.22. The new values are

FASHIONCLEFT allows a new Exfil-Type 2 Packet. It was originally proposed that
three new modes would be used for Packet exfil, using the values 0x02 through
0x04; however, this proposed version was not actually implemented. Applying no
is just what it implies. The term ?munge? implies that privacy scrambling will be
applied to the data to make it a little less tractable to anyone trying to detect a third party
presence in the target system. The RC6/Composite mode uses full 128-bit as
described in section 2.3.2.

As implemented, FASHIONCLEFT Packet exfil should always use 
Mode 2 0x01 2 Default. The actual mode used for Packet exfil is then specified
within the Metadata Block using SHELLGREY tags, as described in section 2.3.2.

2.1.3. Payload (Content Information) Blocks

The payload (FUNNELAPS CNE protocol data) characterizing the contents of the
data packets is composed of two blocks a 16-byte Exfil Header and a variable length
Metadata Block that conforms to the SHELLGREY CNE data protocol. There is no Exfil
Data block in this payload, and the contained data length is therefore reflected with a zero
length indicator in the Exfil Header.

2.1.3.2.

Content of the Metadata Block

The metadata block, encoded according to the SHELLGREY metadata protocol
described in References [1 and 1.2] contains the collection-related information and packet
reconstruction information. The required collection-related items are:

Exfil-ID [must be unique for {ImplantID, TargetlD, DeploymentlD, InstancelD}]

Exfil-Type [Packet or Session]

The reconstruction-related metadata was originally contained in the following
seven tags that show the original source and routing of the packets that were exfiltrated.
These tags are now provided only for informational purposes and are not used to
reconstruct the original packet:

SHELLGREY reconstruction and tags (section 2.3.2) are processed in
the order in which they occur. The reconstruction result is therefore highly dependent on
the specific reconstruction tags used and the order in which they occur. This flexibility
allows the sender (the implant) to specify how to transform the exfiltrated data and the
receiver simply follows instructions without needing any knowledge of custom/proprietary
data formats.

All communication will be with the appropriate level of for
the information, transmission medium, and target system. RSA public keys are used to

private keys. RC6 block ciphers are used to the Session Announcement Exfil Header

Indicators contained within the Session Announcement Implant Header.

The FLASHHANDLE Mission Management (FMM) system is the database
resource for generating/retaining keys and other information Implantld?s, Targetld?s).
All Session Announcements must have two 128-byte header blocks. The
Infrastructure and Implant Header blocks are using the RSA-128 algorithm. Metadata

The Exfil Header is using the Session Key (RC6) and MI
from the Implant Header. Success is verified by comparing Exfil Header bytes 1215
with Implant Header bytes 48-51.

A Composite Exfil Key (RC6) is computed by combining the Session Key (RC6)
with the Shared Key (RC6). First, populate a 32-byte array with the 16-byte Shared Key followed
by the 16-byte Session Key. Next, perform a SHA1 hash of this byte array. The first 16 bytes of
the resultant SHA1 hash is the Composite Exfil Key (RC6).

The Data Packets are optionally RC6 or munged as specified by
SHELLGREY tags as described in section 2.3.2.

2.3. Data Packets
2.3.1 Data Packet Description

Data packets are IP packets, which may or may not be a copy of an intercepted IP
packet. These packets have a valid IP header, to allow the packet to be routed to the LP
address. Other bytes within this packet may be altered to allow the packet to pass the
target?s egress filters, and/or satisfy a specific packet selection criterion. The SHELLGREY
tags contained within the Metadata Block specify reconstruction and commands
that are processed in the order in which they occur, to transform the received Data Packet
into the desired data format for further processing. The reconstruction result is therefore
highly dependent on the specific reconstruction tags used and the order in which they
occur. For example, as shown below, the received Data Packet always contains an IP
header, but the SHELLGREY tag can be used to remove the
IP4 header. Subsequent SHELLGREY commands could then operate on either the
remaining ?Packet buffer? layer, or on the Transport layer (if it exists).

2.3.2.3 RC6/Composite

RC6/Composite is defined as RC6 using Output Feedback Mode (OFB)
mode, using the Composite Exfil Key (RC6), with a different MI for each data packet. For
each data packet an independent packet MI is computed from the base MI sent in the
Implant Header, modified by one or more bytes from the data packet IP header. This
allows each data packet to be separately, regardless of previous packet losses.
The MI modifier is specified as mimOffset and mimLength (in bytes) into the IP header.

The MI modi?er defaults are (mimOffset=4, mimLength24), which specify bytes 4-7
from the IP header:

- IP Identification Field (2 bytes)
- IP Flags, (3 bits)
- IP Fragment Offset (13 bits).

To compute the individual packet MI, the MI modifier bytes from the IP header are
with the base MI from the Implant Header as follows:

- packetMI[0..15] implantHeader.Ml[0..15] implantHeader[76..91]
- packetM I[i] mimLength-1}

2.4. Transmission

Session Announcements can be transmitted in several ways. These are:
0 Raw IP packet (T sent to predetermined LP and port.
a TCP connection
- Steganographic Tunnel

Using a raw IP packet, a single IP packet would be constructed where the SA would be
contained within the IP transport protocol?s payload. The IP and transport protocol (T 
would be constructed to route the packet to a predetermined destination IP address, IP protocol, and
for the port number. This method provides no reliable transport. Note: Currently, only
UDP SA packets have been implemented.

Classification: Top Secret COMINT X1

Using a TCP connection, the SA would be sent as stream data to a predetermined
destination IP address and TCP port number. This method offers not only reliable network transport,
by allows acknowledgement feedback from the LP, making this method reliable.

Using a steganographic tunnel the SA would hide within a higher-level network protocol.
This method offers both improved OPSEC from detection, but also offers reliable transport by
allowing acknowledgement feedback from the LP.

Transmission of data packets would be similar to raw IP packet by its nature, but only the
destination IP address is predetermined, all ports and ICMP packets are allowed.

Selection of method and parameters would be subject to the security posture imposed by a
target environment.

2.5. Constraints and Timing Issues

The FASHIONCLEFT protocol is designed to operate over an unreliable
network protocol where only communication from the sender is possible. Unless the
Session Announcement could occur using a reliable network protocol, and even a
bidirectional protocol, the data packets are clearly unreliable. To 
FASHIONCLEFT communications between the sender and receiver entities under all
conditions, certain constraints and timing issues must be observed. Basically, the
FASHIONCLEFT sender (implant) has an active role for maintaining proper
while the receiver (LP) has a passive role. What follows is a list of
conditions; follow by a discussion of each.

- Sending of the Session Announcements
New or Continuation of a terminated Session
Termination of Session
Sending Data Packets to Session Announcement ports
Duplicate Data Packets
Simultaneous Exfil of Multiple Sessions
Early Termination

SENDING OF THE SESSION ANNOUCEMNETS

Generally the Session Announcement (SA) would be send prior to data
packets be sent. If the SA data is sent using an unreliable network transport, it may be lost
in transit. To overcome this, the SA data should be sent more than once. Since data
packets may arrive prior to SA data, the receiver will buffer all received IP packets for
fifteen (15) minutes. Once a valid SA arrives, the buffer will be scanned for possible data
packets. To insure at least one SA arrives, more than three should be sent within the 15-
minute time window, unless the SA is sent using a reliable protocol. In addition, for cases
where the duration of exfiltration of data packets is short and the SA path is unreliable, the
sender should also make at least three (3) attempts to send the SA.

TERMINATION OF SESSION

Once the session is established, the LP will terminate the session and stop
looking for and forward data packets to the backend when the following two conditions are

met:
CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET COM NT X1 DRV FM: 123-2
Dated: 24 Feb 98
DECL ON: X1
Page 1 7 of 26 

Classification: Top Secret COMINT X1

1. No data packet has arrived for ten (10) minutes.
2. No SA has arrived for ten (10) minutes.

NEW OR CONTINUATION OF A TERMINATED SESSION

When an authenticated SA arrives, the packet selection criteria, as well as the
FOGYNULL Identification fields will be used to determine if the packet is new or existing
collection. If new the FASHIONCLEFT receptor will begin data packet collection. If it is
redundant, the SA is ignored.

If the SA that arrives is in actuality for a session that has been terminated, the
FASHIONCLEF receptor will be tasked to start data packet collection as if it was a new
session. The inner portion of the CDR will rejoin these disjoint captures of the same
session, by using the Meta-data tag and FOGYNULL identifiers, provided that
no more than fifteen (15) minutes between termination of the last session and the start of
the next session with the same EXFIL-ID from the implant.

To insure separate session are not inadvertently joined by the CDR, Implants
should allow at least sixty (60) minutes, between the reuse of EXIL-ID values.

 

SENDING DATA PACKETS TO SESSION ANNOUNCEMENT PORTS

To minimize testing every packet, for session announcements, being sent to
the FASHIONCLEFT receptor, only certain destination ports will be monitored for session
Announcements. These ports can be arbitrarily configured to address the needs of specific
deployed implants. If an implant chooses, or is required to by conditions imposed by the
target environment, it may send data packets to these ports as well. Packets that match a
data packet selection criterion are not checked for session announcements. Therefore,
implants that desire to send announcements to the same port as data packets, must
choose packet selection criteria carefully.

DUPLICATE DATA PACKETS

Implants that desire to send duplicate data packets are permitted, and may be
desirable in some cases to insure that critical portions of the session are received by the
FASHIOINCLEFT receptor. Duplicate data packets will occur as an artifact of packet
sniffing by default. Data packets that are either duplicated by design or by coincidence
generally will be removed by post processing during session reconstruction.

SIMULTANEOUS EXFIL OF MULTIPLE SESSIONS

Implants that desire to exfiltrate multiple disjoint sessions simultaneously, or
even sessions back-to-back must utilize the EXFIL-ID in conjunction with the packet
selection criteria. The EXFIL-ID is used to identify disjoint sessions, while a packet
selection criterion is used to associate data packets to a particular session. Implants must
choose both such that both are unique per session, and the above conditions are met.

3. Packet Selection Algorithms I

3.1. Description

This section describes the methods used to associate meta-data with non-
encapsulated egress packets that are transmitted independently from the data that is
desired to be ex?ltrated. Specifically, it addresses allowable contents for the "Packet-I/F-
Selector" and "Packet-I/F-Data" fields of the FOGYNULL Infrastructure Header (INF-HDR).
The following table identifies the specific values for the "Packet-I/F-Selector" field to
select which algorithm to be used to do an association. This indicates whether the
"Packet-I/F-Data? field is used to convey parameters for the selected algorithm. The
"Packet-I/F-Data" field can be up to 32 bytes in length.

The number and format of the bytes comprising the "Packet-I/F-Data" vary based on the
value of However, to allow for cases in which a data receptor may
not understand a particular "Packet-I/F-Selector" value, the "Packet-I/F-Data" field will
always begin with a 1-byte field indicating the number of bytes in the "Packet-I/F-Data" ?eld
(excluding this 1-byte length ?eld). So, for the non-null types specified above, the
corresponding "Packet-I/F-Data" fields are as follows:

This represents the null case, i.e. the case in which there is no defined mapping association.
Hence no packets will be collected; only the metadata is fonrvarded. The content of "Packet-I/F-
Data" is unused.

3.2.2 (U) Generic Pattern Matching, [0x01]

This method implements a generic static pattern matching against specified bytes within
the received packets. The content of ?Packet-I/F-Data" contains a?nite number of matching rules.
These matching rules allow a pattern match against specified bytes following the start of an IP
header; thus, they can include checks against bytes in the headers. (The rules could
include checks against other bytes, but the header checks would probably be the norm.) Thus, this
selector would allow checks against the IP Identifier field as well as elements such as IP addresses,
TCP window size, TCP urgent data size, ports, etc. This method is fairly general and should be able
to cover any case in which portions of these headers contain fixed bytes.

The purpose of the data field is to specify the particular byte offsets and patterns to be used for
matching against received packets. A non-zero number of "pattern blocks" must thus follow the
length field (which specifies the number of bytes in the ?pattern blocks"). Each "pattern block"
consists of three bytes as described below. For this method, a received packet must match the
criteria specified within of the pattern blocks. Using a 1-byte length and 3 bytes/block implies
there can be at most 10 "pattern blocks" within the 32-byte ?Packet-I/F-Data" field. In addition, using
a 7-bit offset implies that the largest offset (from the start of the IP header) is 127 bytes. The format
of this field is:

- <1-byte length> <pattern block block n>
- A pattern block has the following format:

<1-byte offset> - offset from start of IP header or Transport Protocol header.

0 Bit 0: (LSbit) indicates start position, if 0 use start of header, if 1 use
the start of Transport Protocol header.

0 Bit 1-7: offset value (multiply desired offset by 2 to shift into bits 1-7)
<1-byte mask> - mask to be used with pattern
<1-byte pattern> - pattern to be matched
Thus, to perform a pattern block check, verify the following equality:
Packet [IP_Header_Offset <offset>] <mask> <pattern> <mask>

(The above assumes that enough packet bytes are available. For error checking purposes, the
length field should always be a multiple of the pattern block size, i.e. 3, and a pattern byte bit-wised
and - ed with the mask byte should always yield the pattern byte.)

As an example, suppose one wants to match any packet having an IP ID field of 0x1234. (The IP ID
field is 2 bytes long, occurring at offsets 4 and 5 bytes from the start of the IP Header.) Then, the
following data ?eld would be used:

- <1-byte length>: 6

Pattern block: 1

- <1-byte offset>: 8 
- <1-byte mask>: 

- <1-byte pattern>: 0x12
- Pattern block 2

3.2.3 (U) FIxed IP4 Field MatChingi 

This method implements a static pattern matching against a specified subset of
header fields. This method is geared toward the use of the typical 5-tuple of
fields used by IP and TCP (or UDP). In addition, it has the capability to handle both sides
of the traffic, i.e. it allows the source/destination address and port ?elds to be toggled.

Note: The two-sided source/destination toggling described below should normally
not be used. Normally only a single sided pattern should be specified. If togging is used,
there will be no way for the SHELLGRE reconstruction tags to correctiy reconstruct the IP
or Transport Header, since the same reconstruction tags would be applied for both
directions (to. A and A would be received as A and X, but would
reconstructed using the same value for X). The toggling mode can only be used if the IP
and Transport headers will be dropped.

The contents of the data field are used to specify the subset of fields and
associated patterns for matching against received packets. The rationale for having this
method is the belief that it may often be the case that collection can be done based on the
standard 5-tuple used for uniqueness. For this selector, the data field will
always contain the following 24 bytes:

- <1-byte length> - number of bytes following this field (23)
- <1-byte mask> - indicates fields/toggles to be used

a Bit 0: (<mask> 0x01) if set, match on protocol field

a Bit 1: (<mask> 0x02) if set, match on destination IP address [Note: there is
only one destination IP address, and this match is not useful when the
destination IP address must be overwritten with a particular forwarding IP
address]

a Bit 2: (<mask> 0x04) if set, match on source IP address field, use first source
IP field if bit 5 of mask is unset; use both source IP fields if bit 5 of mask is set

a Bit 3: (<mask> 0x08) if set, match on destination port field(s) -- only use first
destination port field if bit 6 of mask is unset; use both destination port ?elds if
bit 6 of mask is set; [Note: if set, then there's an implied match of either UDP or
TCP on IP protocol ?eld]

a Bit 4: (<mask> 0x10) if set, match on source port field(s) --only use ?rst
source port field if bit 7 of mask is unset; use both source port fields if bit 7 of
mask is set [Note: if set, then there's an implied match of either UDP or TCP
on IP protocol ?eld]

a Bit 5: (<mask> 0x20) if set, then allow source IP address to toggle between
the two alternatives

Classification: Top Secret COMINT X1

- Bit 6: (<mask> 0x40) if set, then allow destination ports to toggle between
the two alternatives

- Bit 7: (<mask> 0x80) if set, then allow source ports to toggle between the two
alternatives

- <2-byte Protocol> - IP protocol field used if mask bit 0 is set

- <4-byte - destination IP address used if mask bit 1 is set

- <4-byte - source IP address #1 used if mask bit 2 is set

- <4-byte - source IP address #2 used if mask bits 2 5 are set

- <2-byte DstPort1> - destination port #1 used if mask bit 3 is set

- <2-byte DstPort2> - destination port #2 used if mask bits 3 6 are
set

- <2-byte SrcPort1> - source port #1 used if mask bit 4 is set
- <2-byte SrcPort2> - source port #2 used if mask bits 4 7 are set

While this method allows filtering on a particular 5-tuple (or subset), it's also
intended to handle both sides of a connection. Given that the destination IP
address will typically be fixed (to be the forwarding IP address), the only fields that can
toggle are the source IP address, destination and source ports. This method allows any or
all of those fields to toggle. When toggling checks are being done, only the corresponding
toggling ?elds should be used, e.g. DstPortl, and SrcPortl would be three values
of the 5-tuple (if all are being used and all are allowed to toggle) and DstPort2, and
SrcPort2 would be the three toggled values of the 5-tuple (if all are being used and all are
allowed to toggle).

As an example, suppose a connection for the following 5-tuple is being collected:
TCP: 1.2.3.4/9 5.6.7.8/10

protocol, IP address 1.2.3.4 using port 9 and IP address
5.6.7.8 using port 10]

In addition, suppose the collection is to be forwarded to IP address A.B.C.D and all
but the destination IP address of forwarded packets to remain unchanged. Then the data
field would be as follows:

<1-byte length>: 23
<1-byte mask>: 
<2-byte Protocol>: TCP
<4-byte A.B.C.D
<4-byte 1.2.3.4
<4-byte 5.6.7.8

The above data field indicates a full match is required on all fields of the 5-tuple. It
would match either of the following 5-tuples:

TCP: 1.2.3.4/9 
(Protocol: DstIP/DstPortl)

TCP: 5.6.7.8/10 
(Protocol: DstIP/DstPort2)

To indicate a match on just the IP addresses, the following data field could be used:

<1-byte length>: 23
<1-byte mask>: 0x26
<2-byte Protocol>: <unused>
<4-byte A.B.C.D
<4-byte 1.2.3.4

<2-byte DstPort1>: <unused>
<2-byte DstPort2>: <unused>
<2-byte SrcPort1>: <unused>
<2-byte SrcPort2>: <unused>
The above data field would match any IP packet having either of the following two
IP pairs:
1.2.3.4 A.B.C.D
5.6.7.8 A.B.C.D

Finally, suppose that forwarded packets were to use a spoofed source IP address
of E.F.G.H and a destination port of 7777, but the source port would be allowed to toggle.
In that case, the following could be used:

<1-byte length>: 23

<4-byte A.B.C.D
<4-byte E.F.G.H
