Course Overview:
(C) The Army's massive desert battleground needs to be updated to train troops to fight and
stabilize societies in urban environments. To meet growing Intel needs, the military services will
need to change the way they educate and train their troops, "If military elements are going to
observe at the social level, then they have to have some skills at that level similar to the notion
that technical intelligence needs require certain technical skills. For the future, the Pentagon has
realized that there will be new elements essential to claim a victory -- one which must primarily
emphasize post-combat work, or a level of effective "social intelligence." Becoming increasingly
more important to troops in the "new-age battlefield will be foreign area studies, and studies
that highlight culture, political systems, languages and social structure. Military power is only
one item in a long list of social, political, and economic tasks that will be as important to victory,
or even more so, than bombs, missiles, and guns.
