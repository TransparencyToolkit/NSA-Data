(U) Would You Like Fries With That...Report?
FROM: SSgt
 USAF
MENA Analyst - Forward
Run Date: 04/01/2005

(U) "Working the grill," is a phrase that I use to casually reference my job and have thrown
around among the close friends that I've had the pleasure to work with over the last few years.
Like the many linguists and analysts at the Agency, I've always drawn a lot of pride from the
hard work and support that occurs everyday stateside. As great as that has been its tough to
compare to the work going on at the grill and its not just flippin' burgers!
(U) In September of 2004 I was asked whether I'd consider serving as the MENA representative
at the CSG and replace a good friend who would be departing in January 2005. I jumped at the
opportunity, and despite not fully knowing the extent of the role I would be fulfilling, I was
confident of the impact that would be made. Besides it was a great chance to trade in my set of
linguist cans for an analyst's hat!
(U) I can barely express how huge an experience this TDY has turned out to be for me. It's been
gratifying being able to support the tactical warfighter on a daily basis. Also, seeing a small bit of
the world that is passing through its own historic times has been quite remarkable. Ironically
though, the one tidbit I hadn't really considered before was the newer set of tools I'd be exposed
to and could hone while here. Along with serving as the representative for MENA and supporting
the mission between forward and home, I've acquired a number of tools to go along with my set
of cans that I know will make me an even better linguist/analyst upon my return.
(U) I imagine my bosses back home won't want me to fully trade in my set of cans for the
analyst's hat when I get back, nor do I want to, but I certainly think they'll be getting someone
back who can cook up more then just cheese burgers on the grill. Would you like some fries with
that?!
