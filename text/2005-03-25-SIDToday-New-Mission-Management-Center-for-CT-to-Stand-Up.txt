(U//FOUO) New Mission Management Center for CT to Stand Up
FROM: Charlie Meals
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Run Date: 03/25/2005

(U//FOUO) Developments with the new Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC)
(U//FOUO) In December, the Signals Intelligence Director named Mr. Lonny Anderson as the
first Associate Deputy Director for the Global War on Terrorism ( see the announcement ). We
took this step because the time has come to move beyond the post-9/11 crisis mode and really
"dig in for the long haul" on this target. Lonny and his colleagues will make sure we are tackling
the problem as well as we possibly can.
(U//FOUO) In his new job, Lonny will help optimize the entire gamut of Counterterrorism
activities carried out by SID and our global Cryptologic System -- not a small job! To more
effectively deal with this task, a Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC) is
being established, and today I'd like to fill you in on where it stands.
(U//FOUO) The CT MMC's responsibilities will include:
Synchronize global CT operations across the spectrum and communicate with partners.
Coordinate the offensive and defensive (i.e. SIGINT and Information Assurance) CT
missions.
Maintain awareness of all CT-related activities, such as situations, resources, partner
capabilities, Blue Force/Red Force (i.e. allied and adversary) disposition, customer needs,
targets, daily operations, management decisions, etc. All of this information must be
brought to the attention of leadership and others as appropriate.
Serve as a gateway for customers to interact with NSA, and manage their expectations of
what can realistically be provided.
Identify systemic shortfalls; task and track resolutions.
Provide oversight for the CT budget and supplemental.
Ensure the CT mission is properly staffed, with personnel receiving necessary training
and tools.
(U//FOUO) What will the CT MMC look like? The CT MMC will represent all SIGINT
Directorates and include:
24/7 watch desks which will provide continuity on CT intelligence and operations.
Day desks which will work the major issues affecting the CT mission.
Connectivity with all customers and partners working CT issues.
Integrees invited from CIA, FBI, DIA, the Pentagon, Joint Special Operations Command
(JSOC), and Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
(U//FOUO) What is its status now?
A group with representatives from SID, NSOC, FAD and IAD are planning the Center.
A concept of operations is being developed with all participants.

 We project that Phase 1 of the CT MMC will stand up in the next couple of months.
Phases 2 and 3 will be in operation over the summer 2005.
(U) Obviously there is much work to be done, but all concerned are hard at work to make this
milestone in our approach to CT a reality!
