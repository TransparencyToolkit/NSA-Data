(U) Department of Justice: The Verdict on SID
FROM: 
DoJ Account Manager (S112)
Run Date: 03/28/2005

The Justice Department tells the truth (the whole truth, and nothing but) about how they view
SID (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) SID recently pulsed senior customers at the Department of Justice (DoJ) to find out
what they think about our products, services, and overall relationship. Last fall, the SID Account
Management team held candid discussions ( SCORECARD interviews) with the Attorney
General's point people for intelligence and crimes. Their personal feedback and well-informed
insights are captured in the SID Customer Support Plan, and the resulting Action Plan is being
shared with the Product Lines, Data Acquisition offices, and SID leadership (more below).
(U//FOUO) "Main Justice" serves as the headquarters element for national law enforcement
components-such as FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals, and U.S. Attorney offices -- and it provides
legal policy counsel to Executive Branch offices. Our SID relationship is primarily with the Office
of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) and the Criminal Division . OIPR plays an intelligence
oversight role according to Executive Order No. 12333, "United States Intelligence Activities." It
is also a consumer of SIGINT, which provides valuable background for FISA* applications and for
legal advice to the White House on national security matters.
(U//FOUO) The Criminal Division, on the other hand, more closely resembles a traditional SID
customer. It uses SIGINT as lead information to guide investigations and influence national
policy on:
Terrorism
Espionage
Narcotics
Organized Crime & Alien Smuggling
Other International Crime Activity: Weapons Proliferation & WMD, Computer Crime,
Money Laundering, Sanctions Violations, War Crimes, etc.
SID typically coordinates DoJ issues and interactions with NSA's Office of General Counsel
(OGC).
(U) DoJ's Ruling: Great Job, Keep Improving
(C) OIPR and the Criminal Division are very satisfied with current SID support (rated 4.5 out of
possible 5.0) and commended SID personnel on their responsiveness and exceptional, often
sole-source, products. As these organizations respond to global realities and Attorney General
requirements -- and since SIGINT comprises the bulk of their intelligence information -- they see
the following opportunities to enhance our missions through partnership. SID Customer Gateway
(S11) is ambitiously coordinating the associated actions with NSA stakeholders:
Understand Each Other's Business:
Educate the A&P workforce about the role of SIGINT in DoJ to better focus the SIGINT
system; update DoJ personnel on A&P missions and initiatives
Establish frequent exchanges and senior-level visits
Produce Powerful Reports:
Expand the use of Write-to-Release (WTR) and tearline formats -- DOJ raved about such

 reports as the most "actionable" and "user-friendly"
Enhance summary reporting for terrorism: include social network analysis in graphic
form, background information for context, and drill-down capability for details
Focus on Emerging Threats Now:
Organized crime and failed governments
WMD, Proliferation, Alien Smuggling, Narcotics, Illicit Finance -- the convergence of
terrorism with other crime networks, and abetted by foreign governments -- raises their
threat to homeland security.
