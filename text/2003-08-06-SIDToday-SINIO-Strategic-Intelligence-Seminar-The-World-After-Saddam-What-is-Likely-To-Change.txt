"The World After Saddam What is Likely To Change" will be presented on 12 August from 1200-1400 in Room 9A135<br>(HQS Bldg) . Advance registration is required; instructions are provided at the end of this<br>article.<br>Course Overview:<br>(S//SI) In the first few days of the new SID Leadership Team, the SIGINT Director charged the<br>SINIO Council with producing an assessment on how the most critical intelligence issues facing<br>the nation are likely to change in a post-Saddam world, looking out through 2004. Taking the<br>basic assumption that the United States, its partners, and their adversaries are operating in a<br>modern global environment, and that activities or organizations in one region may have roots<br>that reach far beyond that region, the SINIOs have reexamined the most critical intelligence<br>issues facing the community and grouped them into three categories:<br>Global Threats including Terrorism and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD);<br>World Order issues includes five issues-"Axis of Evil", Regional Stability in the Middle<br>East, "Coalition of the Unwilling," Role and Significance of Multilateral Organizations, and<br>Global Economy;<br>the Changing Battlefield including Military Thinking, Information Operations (IO), and<br>Denial &amp; Deception (D&amp;D;).<br>For each issue the Council has provided an assessment of the consequences for SIGINT in terms<br>of our need to surge, revise, or maintain our efforts against the major targets that comprise<br>that issue. A team of SINIOs will present the Council's analysis of these changes, for the use of<br>the NSA workforce.<br>(U//FOUO) Please consult the SINIO Website ("go sinio") for information on future events in this<br>series.<br>POCs: <br><br>, for SINIO Council<br>for NCS (<br><br>) <br><br>) <br><br>(U) REGISTRATION INFORMATION:<br>(U//FOUO) REGISTRATION: Eligible SID students interested in attending this brown-bag session<br>must send the following information to <br>:<br>COURSE: AREA1500: The World After Saddam - What is Likely To Change<br>NAME:<br>SSN:<br>ORG:<br>(U) NOTE1: Pre-registration is necessary due to limited seating.<br>(U//FOUO) All cleared, U.S. badged SID personnel may apply.
