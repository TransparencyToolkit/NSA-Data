(U//FOUO) eBay? Wired Magazine? The Whole Earth Catalog? You may be familiar with them,
but do you know how they are linked to the SID? Read on to discover the connection.
(U//FOUO) The Institute for Analysis is an exciting Advanced Analysis Lab (AAL)-sponsored
activity designed to reach out to recognized industry experts to leverage previously untapped
intellectual capital in developing new processes, methodologies, techniques and tools for our
analytic community. (See the IFA webpage -- "go IFA" -- to learn more.)
(U//FOUO) Established in October 2004, the AAL selected Global Business Network (GBN),
headquartered in Emeryville, California to manage the IFA. One of the interesting things that
GBN has established for the IFA is a network of experts, the majority of whom have had no
previous involvement with the intelligence community. These experts will work with GBN to
apply strategies employed successfully in the competitive marketplace to challenges
confronting NSA.
(U//FOUO) So what types of people belong to the IFA network of experts? Find out firsthand by
attending a panel discussion on Human Networking, scheduled for 19 May 2005 at 12:15 p.m. in
Friedman Auditorium. The panel will feature three members of the IFA network:
Pierre Omidyar, founder and chair of eBay;
Karen Stephenson, a leader in the field of network dynamics and president of NetForm
International, and
Kevin Kelly, author and one of the founders of Wired Magazine.
Stewart Brand, one of the co-founders of Global Business network and probably best known for
The Whole Earth Catalog, will moderate the panel.
(U//FOUO) Register to attend the 19 May panel discussion on Human Networking by going to
the analysis conference webpage ("go analysis conference") and following registration
instructions. After registering for the panel discussion, sign up for some of the keynote speakers
