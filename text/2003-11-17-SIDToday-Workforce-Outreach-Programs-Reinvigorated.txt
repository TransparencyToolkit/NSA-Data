MG Quirk, Mr. Meals and Mr. Berlin<br>are putting aside time on their incredibly busy calendars to make sure they get to know you,<br>understand what you are doing and learn what is important to you (and vice versa).<br>(U) Shadowing either MG Quirk, Mr. Meals or Mr. Berlin involves spending a day doing<br>everything the leader does: going to meetings, greeting visitors or whatever any given day has<br>to offer.<br>(U) What's On Your Mind involves your workgroup or team and your management. One of the<br>SID leaders will meet with your workgroup in a designated conference room or other<br>appropriate place where the group will be free from interruptions and spend some time,<br>generally 90 minutes, learning what your organization does and the things being done that<br>everyone is proudest of.<br>(U) A Walkabout gives the SID leadership the opportunity to see you, your management and<br>your coworkers in your natural environment, so to speak, no special setting, no equipment<br>demonstrations. It is kind of like shootin' the breeze with your workmates except it's the<br>leadership.<br>(U) Don't delay, sign up today!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
