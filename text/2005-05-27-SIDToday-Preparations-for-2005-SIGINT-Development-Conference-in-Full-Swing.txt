(U) Preparations for 2005 SIGINT Development Conference in Full
Swing
FROM:
SIGDEV Strategy and Governence (SSG)
Run Date: 05/27/2005
(U//FOUO) In less than two weeks, SIGINT Development experts from across the 5-Eyes
community will gather at the annual SIGINT Development Conference (6-10 June). To date,
over 660 people have registered to attend some of the more than 120 presentations,
demonstrations, sidebars and tours.
(U//FOUO) If you haven't visited the conference website recently, we strongly encourage you to
do so. There have been extra briefings added, so you'll want to make sure you've updated your
selections. We're hoping that people will fine-tune (add or delete) their selections so we can
adequately size conference rooms. By clicking on the "personal agenda" link from the menu on
the left side of the conference webpage , you can view your personal itinerary for the week! This
feature will allow you to identify any conflicts, so you're able to easily decide which event you
would like to attend.
(U) If for some reason you can no longer attend the conference, please be sure to withdraw
using the "update personal information" link from the conference webpage.
(U) Plan to attend -- you don't want to miss this exciting event!
