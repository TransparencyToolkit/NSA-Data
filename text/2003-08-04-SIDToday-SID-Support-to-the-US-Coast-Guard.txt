As you could imagine, in the post 9/11 world, information<br>on threats, particularly those against U.S. maritime borders, ports, or the nation's waterways is<br>of the highest interest to the USCG. The USCG uses ELINT and Specific Emitter Identification<br>(SEI) information currently provided by the MATCHLIGHT database to help identify threats to<br>the U.S. in the form of maritime vessels or cargos. This database is maintained by SID's<br>Maritime Analysis Cell, and contains all SEI information received-- whether collected by moving<br>platforms or by eyes-on-target at maritime choke points. USCG may also use this information,<br>fused with other USCG data, to pursue its domestic and law enforcement missions.<br>(C) We can trace the beginnings of the SID-Coast Guard interaction to around 1989 when the<br>USCG, as a member of the Joint Interagency Task Force-West (JIATF-West, located at Coast<br>Guard Island in Alameda, CA) first received signals intelligence support. This support took the<br>form of SANDKEY reporting, which includes Narclites, tippers, and HFDF (High Frequency<br>Direction Finding) information from MRSOC and other SANDKEY participants. This data is used<br>to identify and locate narcotics traffickers and their shiploads of narcotics so they can be<br>detained and/or arrested and their illegal cargo seized. In an example from late June 2003,<br>SID's Commercial Ship Tracking Cell in Denver provided tracking support to GCHQ, JIATF-South<br>(in Key West, Florida), and the USCG that led to the HMS IRON DUKE's seizure of a drugcarrying cargo ship north of Venezuela. This ship contained 3,930 kilos of pure cocaine with a<br>New York City street value of $196,500,000.<br>(C) SID also provides the USCG intelligence in the form of serialized SIGINT product reporting<br>on a wide variety of subjects, including counterterrorism, alien smuggling, counternarcotics,<br>maritime tracking of vessels and/or high-interest cargos and international civilian maritime<br>activities. We look forward to even closer collaboration with our USCG partners in future, and<br>wish them a happy birthday!
