(TS//SI//NF) FAA Certification Renewals With Caveats
B>	2011 -10-12 0850

(TS//SI//NF) The FISA Court signed the 2011 FAA Certifications on 3 Oct 2011 - these
are valid until 2 Oct 2012, permitting SSO FA A-authorized accesses to continue
operations. However, in the SO^page opinion, the judge ordered CertainL‘upstream*’ or
"passivenn FAA DNI collection to cease after 30 days, unless NSA implements solutions
to collect all deficiencies identified in the opinion document. PRISM operations are not
affected by these caveats. All PRISM providers, except Yahoo and Google, were
successfully transitioned to the new Certifications. We expect Yahoo and Google to
complete transitioning by Friday 6 Oct. Regarding the 11011-PRISM FAA collection
programs, the Court cited targeting and minimization procedures related to collection of
Multiple Communications Transactions as “deficient on statutory and constitutional
grounds.” SSO, Technology Directorate, OGC, and other organizations are coordinating a
response, which includes planning to implement a conservative solution in which die
lugher-nsk collection will be sequestered. It is possible tliat tins higher usk collection
contains much of the nomduplicative FAA collection resulting m FAA reporting from
upstream accesses. This solution is designed to comply with the judge's order; however,
the judge will have to determine if it does. If the solution is installed, SSO will then work
with OPIs and OGC to modify the solution over time such that the filtering process will
be optimized to permit more valid collection to be processed and forwarded to OPIs.
Finally, in parallel with these efforts, the OGC is contemplating filing an appeal to the
ruling.
