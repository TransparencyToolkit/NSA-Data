When a server goes down there are many possible issues and many possible solutions. The
easiest and most common issue is a CDR back up. Initially you will see one or two servers go
down. Soon after you will see a few more go down or all depending on how backed up CDR is.
Occasionally, CDR will fix itself pretty quickly and other times will stay down for quite some
time. Normally if CDR is down for more than half an hour, a ROC help ticket would be put in. ...

3. GENERAL FOXACID SERVER INFORMATION

3.1.	(TS//SI) FOXACID SERVER BACKGROUND

The Foxacid server is a Microsoft Windows 2003 server that has the FA server software,
FA plugins, and payloads installed. A series of filters, modrewrite, prefilter, and postfilter (in that
order) are used to provide logic to the server. This logic determines whether a tag coming in
might be changed, what payload a target might get, or a 404 or 200 if it is a blocked IP.

3.2.	(TS//SI) FOXACID SERVER INTERACTION WITH CDR AND DATA FLOW

CDR is the method of data transfer used by the Foxacid servers. Data on the low side is
transferred in an encrypted format to a receiving computer. The data is then transferred to the
high side, decrypted, and placed in its appropriate file location. This includes the data that
populates Foxsearch and our heartbeat files.

Sometimes CDR goes down and/or becomes backed up with an excess amount of data.
There are many projects beyond Foxacid that use CDR and an error in any one of these projects
can affect CDR. Depending on how long there is a problem with CDR will affect just how
current the data is. The greater the backlog in data, the greater the amount of time it will take for
everything to get back up to date.

3.4.(TS//SI) Exploits

Exploitation is the process gaining control of a target's computer. The Foxacid server decides
exploitation, but it can be influenced by the Foxacid Exploitation Tag and by the Modrewrite
filter. Exploitation can fail at any point after the first contact. The first contact is a success in
XSS. After that the process is in the arena of exploitation.

What is a success in exploitation?

•	Payload delivered.

•	404 bad process or 404 already deployed or self deleted.

o Not deploying a payload is a success in exploitation because to get to this point to
make these determinations the server has to have a successful exploitation.

•	404 not vulnerable

o Even though the server did not try to exploit the target this is still a success. The
server stopped the process for a known reason, not the target for an unknown
reason.

What is a failure?

•	There is a failure in exploitation if there are contacts after the initial contact but there is
not a well-defined end to the process by the Foxacid server. This means no Payload, 404,
or 200 message.

What can cause exploitation failure?

•	JavaScript turned off.

•	Target has a slow connection.

•	Target surfs off the page before the process can complete.

•	Browser has extensions loaded. This causes certain exploits to fail.

3.5.	(TS//SI) Wrappers

DireScallop- enables payload persistence against targets that are using the DeepFreeze products.

DeepFreeze is used in many Internet cafes to prevent changes to a computer's
operating system and software applications. It is designed such that when a machine
with DeepFreeze boots it always starts in the same state. DIRESCALLOP disables
DeepFreeze without the need for a reboot. Implants can then immediately execute and
re-enable DeepFreeze after gaining persistence. Automated deployment of
DIRESCALLOP through FOXACID is supported.

DIRESCALLOP 2.0.0.2 emits executables. It does not emit DLL's. The payload
passed to FINKDIFFERENT will be written to disk and then executed. That is why
only -FD1 will work when wrapping it. Failures for -FD2 and -FD3 are expected and
normal. To make DIRESCALLOP an executable, you have to edit the VAL payload
file (config_dv.xml) that it's being thrown with. Open the file and change the wrapper
name of “Disablevalor_SelfDelete_IncludePriv_CheckFirewalls.dll” to
“Disablevalor_SelfDelete_IncludePriv_CheckFirewalls.exe” Make sure to save file
and restart the service.

DisableValor- Exploitation can fail at any point after the first contact. The first contact is a
success in XSS. After that the process is in the arena of exploitation.

3.6.	(TS//SI) PAYLOADS

Payloads are the backdoors that are delivered when exploitation is successful. Requesting
different payloads DOES NOT HELP EXPLOITATION.

Requesting a payload other than the default should be done with care and sound reasoning. Each
change deviating from the default payload is a new line in a configuration file. Each new line in
a configuration file is a new check for the Foxacid server to perform. Each check the server
performs slows the exploitation process. Slowing down exploitation hurts you and other analysts.

Current Payloads

Validator 8.2.1.1 (default)

MistyVeal 11.0.4.3- This payload is only used for special request. It’s used only when targets

have authenticated proxies, PSP Evation, and or special coordination with Interactive
Op.

D R A F T

MistyVeal is a larger implant than Validator. It has a configurable call back time that
can be changed with a granularity of increments in Days, Hours, or Minutes.

MistyVeal cannot call out on the network on its own. It piggybacks on Internet
Explorer to call out on the network. If Internet Explorer is configured to use a proxy,
MistyVeal will be able to use the proxy. This is the major strength that MistyVeal has
over Validator.

If a target is using FireFox and has MistyVeal on the box, MistyVeal does nothing.

If a target is reading emails and Validator is not deploying, requesting MistyVeal for
the target will not help. Requesting MistyVeal payloads DOES NOT HELP
EXPLOITATION.

Special Configuration: For MV 11.0.4.3, change the config.xml file on the servers so
that the overt site check reads http://search.yahoo.com instead of http://
www.yahoo.com

Ferret Cannon- This is a “payload” that can throw any executable that is not normally thrown
from a FOXACID Server, such as, United Rake, Peddle Cheap, PktWench, and
Beach Head. Can throw both a .dll and an .exe. DLLs must use the -FD3 flag,
but always test to be sure.

4. (TS//SI)

When a request is made to throw a payload other than the default, a change must be made
in the filters on that specific server. If a filter type for that request is not present on the server, a
filter must be created. All the filters are in XML format.

When a new exploit or an update of an old exploit comes out, the newest versions of the
plugins must be loaded on to the servers. Since the different plugin versions just add on top of
each other, all the previous ones must be installed on the server. All software that needs to be
installed should be done by MIT. Submit a RocHelp ticket if software needs to be loaded.

Payloads are updated as they are released from DNT and tested. We simply create a test
tag using that payload and try to exploit one of our test images on our FORESTPLACE node.
Occasionally certain payloads are considered too “dangerous” to be used globally so they
become used for CT targets only.

We do not build a server from scratch, we receive a bare bones server that will run and
MIT loads the FA software for us. This includes our server software, payloads, and plugins. MIT
also uploads the VAL IDs, and installs the CDR keys. The FA team is responsible for updating
the Payload ID file, uploading the new filters and configuring the payload config.xml files.

Once a month the server’s times must be checked to make sure that they are all set to
GMT +0, this ensures that when comparing logs, we don’t have to keep on converting times.

8.0 (TS//SI) SERVER IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

When a server goes down there are many possible issues and many possible solutions.

The easiest and most common issue is a CDR back up. Initially you will see one or two servers
go down. Soon after you will see a few more go down or all depending on how backed up CDR
is. Occasionally, CDR will fix itself pretty quickly and other times will stay down for quite some
time. Normally if CDR is down for more than half an hour, a ROC help ticket would be put in.

If a server randomly goes down, an easy fix is to attempt to go into the services and
restart the “FA: Server” service. In normal circumstances, if a server goes down it is usually an
easy fix. One simple issue is that a heartbeat file could have been missed, and the server will
look like it has gone down until the next heartbeat makes it through. If they are not making it
through, make sure that the heartbeat command is still running and that the “tobesent” logs are
making it through. If there is low disk space the logs will stack up and stop being pushed
through and the server will go down.

If a server went down right after a filter update, best guess would be that there is an issue
with that XML file. Most commonly there is a missing closing tag and if you try to open the file
using Firefox, it will normally tell you where the issue lies. Other than that you must look
through everything that you just updated to find where the issue might be.

•	Payload ID- specifies the ID given to the payload that was dropped

•	Proxy Type- specifies name of proxy

Possible Codes/Errors

•	Not Vulnerable- This is an error that you get when the plugin was unable to exploit, and
its not that it failed either. When the survey runs, it sees that the target browser may not
have enough enable (such as flash). The exploit is not able to use these and is unable to
elevate its own privileges, so the survey comes back as "Not Vulnerable". All the exploits
use the same method for privilege escalation as well, so it does not matter which one you
use.

•	Invisible Touch- This is not an error. "Invisible touch" is a contact only from an inert
image tag that we put into our spam messages. The purpose of this tag is to show that the
spam message was opened by the target even though we may not have exploited the
target's machine (i.e. the FOXACID tag possibly was stripped in delivery, etc.)

•	Implant deployed already or self deleted- This is an interesting error, because it is not
always as bad as it looks. When a box calls back to our servers, it goes through our filters
to search for bad (or good depending how you look at it) PSPs and to see if there is
already a payload present. When a payload self deletes for ANY REASON, it leaves an
errata code, telling the next payload why it self deleted. These reasons could be a PSP
that would catch it, self deleting due to not being able to call out in a timely manner, and
a payload is already there. Now for the case of a payload already being there, it could be
there and not calling out, or it is calling out however Foxsearch decided to put the contact
info in a strange place. How Foxsearch places that information is in the date range of
when the VAL/MV FIRST called out, not the latest callback. So this means that it could
be almost all the way at the top of the page. A good way to look for this is watching for
the text in the white boxes saying that there are x number of results but only two are
displayed.

•	Group Not Found- Most commonly there would be an issue with the tag used. Either it
was wrong to begin with, or (most often) for some reason the group portion of the tag
was changed from the point of creation to the point of actually throwing it. Also,
occasionally with the EVAK plug-in, the error will show despite the fact that the plug-in
was able to build and a payload was even dropped. In this case the error is just a fluke.

Once the new server is received, follow the below process to have MIT build the FOXACID
Server.

•	Request CDR Keys and domains for new server

•	Create filters and directory in Clearcase for the new server

•	Update the fa_install (located in Clearcase) with new server information

•	Submit a RocHelp ticket for MIT to install Software in the following order: Server
***Plugins***Payloads***Val ID

•	Install “keys” into C:\main\keys\

•	Edit C:\main\config\server.xml

o Updates include: CDR info (Verify IP and port, TA_ID, TE_ID, and IN_ID), list
begin, list ends, set log forwarding to false

•	Verify C:\main\config\deployment_types.xml

•	Edit each payload config file

•	Update C:\main\payloads\config\ids\fPAYLOAD_ID1.txt (Ex. Server FOX00-6001
payload id - 600100000:600199999

•	Run fa_build_ops_disk.pl from Clearcase to upload new filters to thumbdrive. Then load
updates on RAISEBED/WAITAUTO. If you’re logging on to RAISEBED, upload from
command prompt by running fa-install.pl and select necessary server. If you’re logging
into WAITAUTO, you need to log in to the specific server that you’re trying to update
and then upload from the command prompt.

•	Have MIT schedule “server heartbeat”.

•	Edit C:\main\config\server.xml

o Start log forwarding

•	Ensure logs are being moved through CDR

Testing FOXACID Server build

•	Log on to a virtual machine

•	Open a command prompt to run the below command from the desktop location

o info -prep (cleans the box)
o info -check (shows if the box is clean of exploits)

•	Open a browser on a virtual machine.

•	Open task manager to observe the current processes running

•	Test payload with a test tag and use a TLN from the 99xx series and msgid zlzzz

•	After execution is complete, clean the box once more and re-check it.

Once installed and configured, expand your view (your sid) within Clearcase and drill down to
Ops_Mgmt/FOXACID/Server/binaries/ALL-MASTER-FILES/master_filters. You will see all of
the servers and within each folder there will be the mod, pre, and post filters.

To make changes to the filters, you have to select the server you want and then select the filters
by right clicking them to select “Check Out”. Enter a brief message to say why you’re checking
it out and click “Ok.” To know you checked out a filter, there will be a green check on the filter
to let you know that it has been checked out. Right click the filters again to open them in
Notepad++.

In order to understand how to create filters, you need to understand the order of the filters and
what they each are used for. The modrewrite is where we can re-write the tag to make it look like
something else or hit on a different group. Next, you have the prefilter, which is used to whitelist
and blacklist any IPs/HMACs/TLNs that you want to proceed thru the prefilter or stop at the
prefilter. Last, the postfilter is where exploitation occurs, so this is where all payloads are loaded.

In every filter you will have the following pieces:

•	Filter Label- this is a label of your choice that tells you what the filter is for/doing

•	Filter ID- this is the unique ID (guid) that can only be used once on a filter. The guids are
found in the binaries folder in the lotsofguids—USE_THIS_FILE_FOR_NEW_Filters.txt
file

•	Enabled- this is used to set the filter to “true” or “false”. True makes the filter active on
the server and false makes it inactive

•	FilterMatch datatype- this tells you what type of information you will be filtering on

•	MatchType- this will be ci_string or ci_contains

•	Item Name-This item will be the information that you are trying to capture, such as IP,
TLN, MAC, path, and/or process

•	Action Rating- the order in which the filter will be read. It hits the filters from highest to
lowest

•	Name- this determines how the filter will continue

•	Flags (Optional) An optional attribute that is commonly used for payload wrappers like
DIRESCALLOP and DISABLEVALOR. The latest release of FOXACID also uses this
attribute to flexibly change the payload instantiation method. This is extremely useful for
PSP evasion.

-FD2 : Load DLL directly into memory

-FD3 : Inject DLL into svchost.exe (should be set to this)

• Thresholding (Optional) An optional attribute that can be applied to a specific filter or to
the entire set of filters. Setting a default threshold is done at the top level of the XML as
an attribute to filters. Otherwise it is included as an attribute to the action element.
Thresholds can be set per initial contact (maxThreshold), or specific to an amount of
time. If paired with a deploymentType filter (for example), the threshold can also be
checked against the Target and/or Deployment ID. Once a maxThreshold has been met,
all contacts will receive a 404 until the threshold is cleared.

Example: action rating="1000" maxThreshold="10" maxTime="5"
includeTid="true" name="go"

Every Filter Match needs to have a closing Filter Match.

Loading SSL certificates on FA Server

Contact MIT to inform them that you will be loading SSL certificates on servers.

•	Insert CD that has SSL certificates loaded on them into PC.

•	Log on to server that you will be uploading the SSL certificates.

•	Copy all certificates from CD into the C:\main\keys directory

•	There should be two important files: cert and key

o Open each file in notepad to see which is which, the key file will begin with
“BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY” and end with “END RSA PRIVATE KEY”. If any
other information is before or after that, you can delete the information. The cert
file begins with “BEGIN CERTIFICATE” and ends with “END CERTIFICATE”.
If any other information is before or after that, you can delete the information.

o Rename the cert and key files. Whatever names are already assigned add

_key.pem to the key file and _cert.pem to the key and certificate files respectively.
Here is an example: Original file names- whatever.com.privkey and
whatever.com_cert key; New names- whatever.com_key.pem and
whatever.com_cert.pem

•	Once certificates have been renamed, edit the server.xml file located at C:\main\config

o Set SSL ENABLED VALUE= true

o Make sure the SSL_PORT NUM_VALUE = 443

o Copy the exact names of the key file and cert file into the SSL_KEY and
SSL_CERT VALUES. These names will come AFTER the backward slash.

■	SSL_KEY VALUE= “keys\whatever.com_key.pem”/>

■	SSL_CERT VALUE= “keys\whatever.com_cert.pem”/>

•	RESTART the FAServer service
Decrypting files for Beachhead

This is the proper way to decrypt files for BEACHHEAD. When you log on to a Linux terminal,
open a shell. No Quotes are used in the command shell.

•	Mount your thumbdrive by entering “mz” then press ENTER and then type “cd /mnt/zip”
then press ENTER again.

•	You can view the directory that you are in by entering “ls” to list

•	If your files are located in another folder on the thumbdrive, you need to cd into that
directory. For example, if you have a folder called BEACHHEAD, you can get to the
directory by “cd BEACHHEAD” press ENTER and then view the contents to make sure
you are in the right folder.

•	Once you are in the proper directory, make sure all of the files you need are in the same
place. You will need the decrypt file “gdi32.exe.gpg” and all the files that need to be
decrypted.

•	If the file that needs to be decrypted is called “wtime_PIG.gpg” and you want to make it
a .dll, enter the below command

o Enter command “gpg -o wtime_PIG.dll -d witme_PIG.gpg” press Enter
o Enter the passcode provided

•	After this command is entered, the .dll file will be added to the directory that you are
working from

•	Before removing your thumbdrive, you have to unmount it.

o “cd” then press ENTER (no quotes)
o “uz” then press ENTER (no quotes)

Unzipping files for Beachhead

•	Mount your thumbdrive by entering “mz” then press ENTER and then type “cd /mnt/zip”
then press ENTER again.

•	You can view the directory that you are in by entering “ls” to list

•	If your files are located in another folder on the thumbdrive, you need to cd into that
directory. For example, if you have a folder called BEACHHEAD, you can get to the
directory by “cd BEACHHEAD” press ENTER and then view the contents to make sure
you are in the right folder.

•	Once you are in the proper directory, make sure all of the files you need are in the same
place.

•	You want to enter the below command then press enter. The files will extract to the
directory that you are currently in

o tar xzrf newlanders.tgz

Queuing VAL for Beachhead

When a VAL ID is queued through OLY/UR, make sure they have “execute after put” and “stop
processing” selected.

To verify the test is calling back to the appropriate IP, run netstat -ano 5 inside a command
prompt.

•	If for some reason you are having trouble queueing a file from OLY, try to see if you can
run the .dll manually from the Forestplace VM for testing. To run the file manually, enter
the below command in a command prompt

O Rundll32.exe val.dll, Init test.txt (val.dll is the file you want to run and test.txt is whatever
name you want to name it)

Frugalshot/DementiaWheel Tags

(TS//SI) FrugalShot is a TAO infrastructure component that supports exploit callbacks. The
FrugalShot server is actually a FOXACID server running a set of plugins compatible with
deployments of exploits for removable media, e.g. EasyHookup. In particular, the server uses
FIDO, EPL and FRDO plugins. The use of the FIDO and EPL plugins provides the capability of
delivering a payload upon receipt of the initial exploit callback. The use of the FRDO plugin
provides the capability to capture DementiaWheel data exfiltrated by subsequent exploit
callbacks.

(TS//SI) There can be multiple FrugalShot servers. Currently, there are two main operational
servers:

•	FS501: This server supports callbacks from the CASTLECREEK deployment. The EPL
plugin must be for v1.5. In addition, the version of FinkDifferent embedded within the
payload does NOT support the downloading of a DLL, i.e. it only supports the
downloading and execution of an EXE payload. There are particular cleaner payload files
created specifically for use with servers supporting CASTLECREEK data.

•	FS502: This server supports callbacks from non-CASTLECREEK deployments. It too
requires an EPL plugin supporting v1.5. However, the embedded payloads used for these
deployments use a slightly newer version of FinkDifferent than was used for
CASTLECREEK and can support the downloading and execution of EXE or DLL
payloads. There are particular cleaner payload files created specifically for use with
servers supporting non-CASTLECREEK data.

FS501

IPs are added to the server to receive DementiaWheel callbacks. No tags are generated for this.

Loading certificates on FA Server

1.	Request SSL certs and a domain by submitting a ROCHELP ticket. Should specify name
of the domain and the IP of the server that you want the domains on.

2.	Once the certs have been created, they will need to be obtained either by “go dropbox”
thumbdrive, or what has normally done, CD. Obviously you will need to physically go to
the person who created the certs if you are going to use a CD or a thumbdrive. This is
done by someone within MIT.

8.	DO NOT USE THE BACK BUTTON!!! It won’t work. This is all technically
one page.

Tag Maker https:

1.	The Tag Maker is separate from the Project Tracker. Any servers/domains that were
added to one must also be added to the other. Buttons on the left allow you to add
tags, domains, and servers.

2.	To add a tag click on the “Add a Tag” button.

3.	Add in the Project Name (all caps), select the server, add a TLN or a place holder
“[TLN]/[HMAC]” if there is no TLN (if the Op will be using HMACs), and MSGID.

4.	For MSGID you can use either a normal MSGID from \\Nfs9\foxacid\docs
\DeploymentCategories.xls

5.	OR if the project is going to be using SECONDDATE, you must use the
“ace02468bdf13579” MSGID. This is mandatory in all SECONDDATE operations.
This creates a date time stamp when the tag is being used. This time stamp prevents
constant re-exploitation from the target hitting the back button in their browser.

6.	To reference other tags on the server, click “View Server Tags”.

7.	To reference all other tags, click “View All Tags”

8.	When creating a tag, there are drop down menus to select each portion of the tag.

9.	Domain: Completely arbitrary.

10.	Path/Plugin-type: Also completely arbitrary

11.	List Begin/End: Again, arbitrary. NOTE: When you select the List Begin, it will
automatically select the proper List End.

12.	Group: Only one group to select from. “1”. If another group is needed it can be edited
before sending the tag off to the analyst/operator. Done only in special cases since
default for every server is “1” group.

13.	Deployment Type: While selecting anyone of these will not render the tag useless for
certain ops, the portion in ( ) is what should be selected for the appropriate type of
operations. EX. A SECONDDATE Operation or MAGICBEAN should be using the
“(WEB)” Deployment Types. YATCHSHOP tags will use “YS” Spam tags should
have “SPAM” and QUANTUMINSERT should have “QI”.

14.	Once all the fields have been selected, click “Create Tag” to fully view the tag you
just created. Make sure there are no spaces.

15.	“Save Tag” will then save the tag to the system.

16.	To Edit tags, either view tags or view all tags and next to each tag there is an EDIT
button. Click the button and you can edit any portion of the tag. This will reset all
fields to default, so be sure to re-select fields you want to stay the same. The tag you
are editing will appear at the top of the page.

FABULOUSFABLE is used in automated SECONDDATE tasking. Instead of an
interactive Op to put up inject rules, WATCHER tips hit the FROZENGAZE system
and FABFAB triggers on selectors (MD5 hashed user names). By default rules will
go up for 15 minutes (900 seconds) and after that time, the rule will be terminated.

Each project is found under /fg3.0/config/(HEX values). 0x92.... Is DARKFIRE

0xdd...is a CCNE project. 0xf4f is CRYPTICSENTINEL. DARKHELMET has

three 0x5a3cb41c/d/e

Under each project are the selectors that can be matched on. You can tell a selector is
active by looking at the file and seeing three lines separated from the main file that
say ACTION=FAB, RULES=1,2,3,4,5(or what ever rules they want put up), and
TIMEOUT=900 (or however long the rules need to stay up).

Each of the selector files are the same with the exception of the name being specific
to a user name (remember MD5 hashed) and the FAB rules at the bottom. So when
creating new ones you can just cp one of the other files that has the info you need.

The thost_ file is the default action for any selectors that hit that project but don’t
have a selector file.

Each selector has a start and a stop file, one more directory deep in /xml. These are all
the same with the exception of the name being selector specific. You can cp the
start_template.xml and stop_template.xml the create new start and stop files. Every
selector needs BOTH THE START AND STOP FILES AND THE sel hash file.

7.	Under /fg3.0 there is a logfile.txt. It is a REALLY BIG FILE. Less it to see what
selectors have hit and what actions were taken.

8.	Under /usr/local/fabulousfable/results are all of the result files. You can view these to
see EXACTLY what happened with a certain selector. You have to match up times
from when rules were hit in the logfile.txt and the FfResult files (may be a minute or
two off from the time the selector was hit). In these files you can also see the
SECONDDATE commands and whether they failed or not.

MODREWRITES

This is how Modrewrites actually work.

1.	When using modrewrites to change tags incoming to the server, you can either rewrite the
WHOLE tag or only a certain portion of it. However, you can match on more than what
you are replacing.

2.	EXAMPLES:

<item name="/svn/branches/" />

<action rating="1000" flags="merge" name-'/cgi/modules/" />
/svn/branches/ is matched then replaced by /cgi/modules/

<item name="/mysteriously/cheap.html" />

<action rating="999" name="/public_html/app/component/1/database/
display254705_f2asj.html" />

/mysteriously/cheap.html is matched on then replaced by
/public_html/app/component/1/database/display254705_f2asj.html

When you want to match AND replace EXACLTY you can only go to the “/” right before the
deployment type, OR the whole tag. SECONDDATE TAGS CANNOT HAVE THE WHOLE
TAG MATCHED AND REPLACED ON. This is due to the “ace” timestamp tag. It changes
constantly when used so you will NEVER BE ABLE TO MATCH ON IT. However you might
have the need to match on a certain TLN or HMAC without modrewritting every tag out there
with a certain middle section of a tag. This is how you would do that. EX.

<item name="/app/helpers/callers/1/ctrl/display3bf1b1e75e8da91b86a3e767b192cf0118ea8fb6"/

>

<action rating="999" flags="merge" name="/app/helpers/callers/dyt/ctrl/"/>

This MATCHES on /app/helpers/callers/1/ctrl/
display3bf1b1e75e8da91b86a3e767b192cf0118ea8fb6
But it only REPLACES /app/helpers/callers/1/ctrl/ with
/app/helpers/callers/dyt/ctrl/

GUID Creation.

1. In a command promt switch to foxacid2 (for me it is P drive, so I'll use that as an
example)

cd to P:\fa-server-backs\binaries\

2.	Then run "faguidgen.exe 200 >> lotsofguids------

USE_THIS_FILE_FOR_NEW_Filters.txt

3.	This will append 200 new guids to the lotsofguids file

4.	If for some reason this creates a new file with 200 GUIDs in it, just copy those GUIDs into the
lots of GUIDs file and delete the extra file that was created.

CASTLECREEK Whitelist

1. The “CC” whitelist is on FS501, where DEMENTIAWHEELs call back to. By
default, the prefilter is a go, and the postfilter gives out a DMW cleaner. There is a
payload on the server to not only give a DMW cleaner, but also put down a Validator.
The filters take up a majority of the postfilter, only covers a max of a Class C IP
range, and each network will have a filter with a maxthreshold of 10 (so we don’t go
crazy with Validators in a network). The filters look like this.

<filter label="IP Deploy Val- DH8" filterId="FA-c52126fb-f005-4ebd-9f70-fe3b3d1b2248"
enabled="true">

<filterMatch dataType-'socketip" matchType="ip">

<item name="203.99.164.199" />

<action rating="1070" maxThreshold="10" name="FerretCannon-Win32-1.0.0.1-
VALDMW" />

</filterMatch>

</filter>
