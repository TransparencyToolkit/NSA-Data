Summary

Individual Subscriber Authentication Keys, or Ki values, are required to decrypt GSM
communications. They are stored both on the mobile user’s SIM card and at a Home Location
Register operated by the provider. TDSD has developed a methodology for intercepting these
keys as they are transferred between various network operators and SIM card providers. This
is now a core part ofTDSD’s business carried out by analysts in the team. This report
explores the introduction of an automated technique with the aim of increasing the volume of
keys that can be harvested. Methods are also explored to use data from the automated system
to assess the effectiveness of current techniques and improve TDSD’s knowledge of mobile

network operations.

TOP SECRET STRAP1

1 Introduction

TDSD’s key harvesting methodology centres around collecting Ki values in transit between
mobile network operators and SIM card personalisation centres. Provisioning information is
often sent between these organisations by email or FTP with simple encryption methods that
can be broken out by OPC-CAP, or occasionally with no encryption at all1 * * 4. With targeting in
place, a large volume of IMSI and associated Ki values can be harvested from UDAQ -
GCHQ’s corporate C2C data repository.

With known individuals and operators targeted, items of interest can often be returned from
bulk C2C data using a simple search for the terms ‘Ki’ and ‘IMSI’ in close proximity. Results
will often contain a large number of unrelated items, however an analyst with good
knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of
large batches of Kis.

Work has already been carried out to automate this sifting of bulk data; reference 1 describes
techniques successfully trialled so far. This work builds upon these techniques introducing a
system to bulk query UDAQ itself, perform the sifting operation on data to identify items of
interest, packaging these up in a form that can usefully be interpreted by researchers in OPC-
CAP. Summary information is also produced for the use of analysts in TDSD.

The main desired outcomes from this work are to:

•	Improve TDSD’s effectiveness at finding Kis in C2C content repositories. By
automating the approach it should be possible to perform a more thorough search than
TDSD has had the manpower to do at present. This is likely to bring higher volumes
of Kis and IMSIs to light in addition to spotting interesting items that would not have
come to the attention of analysts previously.

•	Improve TDSD’s target knowledge. A more complete picture of IMSI/Ki data in C2C
repositories will allow TDSD to view the effectiveness of current targeting, spot
trends as target behaviour changes and also spot any obvious gaps in coverage - for
example providers for whom this type of harvesting is ineffective.

•	Develop and enhance TDSD’s harvesting methodology. This methodology is based
around knowledge of how network operators, SIM suppliers and hardware providers
co-operate to share cryptographic data. By looking at the types of organisations
associated with traffic seen in the wild we can test assumptions about communication
patterns we expect to take place, improving our knowledge of relationships between
these companies.

1 It should also be noted that TDSD have observed the use of strong encryption products being used

(eg. PGP products). These have become increasingly common and used as standard for large SIM

suppliers/personalisation centres to exchange SIM output and input data with mobile network
operators.

Additionally it is likely that similar opportunities exist to introduce this type of automation to
other analyst tasks. This work will help develop requirements for such services and bring
more automation opportunities to light. 5

2	Approach

Figure 1 shows a high level overview of TDSD’s current manual harvesting methodology.

Figure 1 - Manual Ki
Harvesting Process

Analysts in the team regularly perform queries on targeted C2C intercept using UDAQ. A
number of queries exist designed to return results likely to contain IMSI and Ki values.
Queries often return results with a high noise threshold - of several thousand results perhaps a
few hundred will contain items of value. The next stage is to trawl these results for items of
value. If a list of IMSI and Ki values is found this can be copied from the tool and sent on to
OPC-CAP for further processing. In the best case lists of several hundred thousand Kis
associated with IMSI values can be found. However, a large number of messages each contain
only a few associated Ki values. The responsibility of converting IMSI/Ki lists into a storable
form lies with OPC-CAP; TDSD analysts can only spend limited time manipulating the
layout of data before forwarding.

2.1	Automated Technique

Figure 2 describes 3 stages of the automated method developed.

Figure 2 - Automated Ki Harvesting
Process

Details of each stage is provided below:

2.1.1	Bulk Data Retrieval

ICTR provide a bulk data download capability using the research server
LLANDARCYPARK. This was used to automate the querying of C2C content in UDAQ.
Given a standard SQL query wrapped in an XML form this will return a package containing
all matching C2C intercept.

A base query, a proximity search for the strings TMSI’ and ‘Ki’, was used for this experiment.
This can be seen in Appendix 1. Date fields are marked with placeholders so these can be
automatically filled out using regular expressions at run time.

Results are returned as a compressed file containing a CCDF2 mesh. A routine was then
written to unpack this mesh, allowing results to be treated from then on as a set of plain text
files.

Scripts were developed to perform all steps of the operation automatically, retrieving
packaged data to be interpreted by the user (reference 6). This operates as follows:

The script JrunRemoteQuery.sh is used to launch the process. This:

•	Requests a date range to query

•	Rewrites the query XML file with required dates

TOP SECRET STRAP 1

TOP SECRET STRAP 1

•	Transfers all required files onto the LLANDARCYPARK server, including
pulludaq.sh

pulludaq.sh is then executed on LLANDARCYPARK. This:

•	Executes the bulk IIB query (can take 5-10 mins)

•	Retrieves query results as compressed CCDF files

•	Unpacks the CCDF contents into a directory as plain text for processing.

The next stage is to identify content of interest in the processed files.

2.1.2	Identifying Content

Once plain text is retrieved from IIB this is parsed to identify items containing IMSI and Ki
values. A previously proven rule based approach is used to identify content of interest.

The routine scrapes the plain text identifying lines containing IMSI and Ki values, which may
appear in intercept in any conceivable format. The technique also attempts to identify header
information describing the contents, as well as associating results with a UDAQ identifier that
can be later researched. Further technical discussion on this technique is available in reference
1, TDSD Technical Note 11: What Makes a Good PCS Key Harvester?.

A final stage generates statistics and additional information linked to the results, developed in
consultation with TDSD analysts. This includes:

•	A list of unique UDAQ item identifiers resulting in valid Ki / IMSI data. This allows
analysts to conduct further research into these traffic sources. These are ranked
according to the number of sections of IMSI data seen in each UDAQ item.

•	A list of network and country codes identified. These are derived from the first 6
characters of an IMSI and used to provide an overview of countries and networks
identified.

•	A list of associated email addresses. This is generated by scraping all email addresses
from results found to contain valid Ki data. These are then ranked by the number of
occurrences of each address.

Care should be taken when interpreting ranking positions. In the case of email addresses a
higher score does not necessarily indicate association with more Kis, however they can
provide an indication of how active an address is.

An example set of statistics produced is shown in Appendix 2.

2.1.3	Processing / storing

Output files generated by the previous step typically take the form shown in Appendix 3 -
section markers separate the UDAQ item reference, potential header information and IMSI/Ki
content. This format was developed alongside OPC-CAP. It should be noted that although the
content will contain IMSI and Ki data it could take any conceivable form - it is presented as
found in raw intercept. It is the task of OPC-CAP to interpret any additional data in any
recognised header section, decoding as necessary. Ki values may still be encrypted at this
stage.

TOP SECRET STRAP 1

OPC-CAP have developed and successfully trialled techniques to speed up the task of
importing these scripts, indentifying expected column header names and mapping these to
data fields, and even automating the final decryption stage.

Once properly interpreted these Ki values can be stored, encrypted or clear, in relevant
databases and shared with partners as necessary.

2.2	Possible improvements

A number of improvements have been identified for the above technique. These are described
below:

•	Improved access rights for bulk data retrieval

Access to ICTR’s bulk access capability runs on research prototype hardware and is
supported only on a best endeavours basis. Making use of a processing user to obtain
data, the maximum classification that can be returned is TOP SECRET STRAP2 UK
Eyes Only. This means that some data currently retrieved using the manual method,
such as password-recovered items, is not available to the automated system. An
improved system would allow bulk access to more intercept data.

•	Processing performance

Performance of queries on LLANDARCYPARK is comparable to that of UDAQ,
however when large numbers of items are retrieved the generation of statistics can
take some time (sometimes hours for large sets). Some simple code optimisations
could significantly improve this performance.

•	Improvements to summary information scores and ranking

The value of using rani« to assess the usefulness of an email or UDAQ item
identified is limited, since the score used relates to the number of sections of Ki data
in a given file. This means where a very large number of IMSIs are identified, but
they appear in a single block, a low score is awarded. A value relating to the number
of IMS I items would be more useful to identify the most important results.

3	Running Trials

The automated harvesting technique was used to extract IMSI and Ki values from bulk data
over a 3-month period. This was performed over six 2-week intervals. The resulting number
of IMSIs, Kis and associated statistics produced are shown in Table 1.

Query Start	Query End	Unique  email  addresses  identified	UDAQ  items	# unique country codes	# IMSIs paired with Ki
30-Dec-09	14-Jan-10	130	18	10	7,802
13-Jan-10	28-Jan-10	4	39	11	8,960
27-Jan-10	ll-Feb-10	18	42	12	1,809
10-Feb-10	25-Feb-10	4	50	18	2,348

10-Mar-10	25-Mar-10	9	8	16	473

Table 1 - Details of Trial Queries

The technique can be seen to identify a steady stream of IMSI and Ki data over a period of
time. UDAQ item identifiers which contain the IMSI and Ki data can additionally be provided
to analysts allowing sources to be further investigated.

These results are further analysed in the following section:

3.1 Activity of Networks

Unique country codes identified in each of the time periods were correlated to produce the
chart shown in Figure 3. Only networks with significant results are shown - raw data can be
seen in Appendix 4.

Figure 3 - IMSIs identified with Ki data for Network Providers

This shows the number of IMSIs found with Ki data in each period for the providers shown,
portraying a steady rate of activity from several networks of interest. New Ki and IMSI pairs
are regularly seen for AWCC, TDCA and MTN.

A large batch of Somali Kis was recovered in mid-March using this automated process.
Somali providers are not on GCHQ’s list of interest, hence it is likely this item would have
been missed by manual collection, however this was usefully shared with NS A. A number of
other unexpected providers were brought to light including Babilon-Mobile in Tajikistan and
Icelandic provider Nova 3G.

This has demonstrated that an automated Ki recovery method can effectively identify IMSI
and Ki pairs from bulk C2C sources for key targets, with the added benefit of identifying
content that would not normally come to analyst attention. The chart presented provides an
overview of networks accessible in C2C repositories.

3.2	Target Discovery

TOP SECRET STRAP 1

TOP SECRET STRAP 1

An experiment was carried out to make use of results from this technique for target discovery.

Statistics produced alongside IMSI/Ki results include email addresses appearing in
communications alongside this content. These email addresses are scored by the number of
times they are seen. It was proposed that analysis of these addresses should bring to light
common communication patterns between operators, as well as help identify actors most
involved in the sharing of Ki data.

UDAQ C2C collection is targeted; hence any traffic found will originate from an identifier in
GCHQ’s corporate systems. However it was surmised that additional useful contact addresses
could be found associated with traffic.

All email addresses associated with traffic in each of the 6 periods were compiled together.
This resulted in a list of 154 unique email addresses, each associated with a score. From this it
was possible to identify a number of candidate targets for further research that scored highly:

•	^^^^^@gmail.com - target’s email handle suggests an Ericsson employee
using a webmail account

•	^^^J(5)huawei.com - this was the highest scoring overall address, a previously
unknown target on the Huawei network.

•	email.com - highest scoring webmail address, indicating lots of activity
associated with IMSIs and Kis, was a previously unknown target.

•	mtn ics.mc - a number of users associated with this previously unknown domain.
JEDI research shows international gateway for South African provider MTN

•	.............. ii< "i" - an MSN address found to be associated with IMSIs and Kis

This has demonstrated a number of opportunities to apply this harvesting technique to target
discovery efforts.

3.3	Measuring Targeting Effectiveness

An experiment was carried out to discover the effectiveness of TDSD’s current targeting
methods.

Email addresses identified in the previous section were converted into a list of domains, again
scored by the number of associations with IMSI/Ki data. The complete list can be seen in
Appendix 5.

It was then possible to group domains into 5 categories:

•	Hardware Companies - Organisations such as Huawei, Ericsson, who manufacture
PCS hardware.

•	Network Operators - Operators of mobile networks such as MTN Irancell,
Belgacom.

•	SIM Suppliers - SIM Suppliers or SIM Personalisation centres, for example Bluefish.

•	Mail Providers - Users of general email providers (Gmail, Yahoo etc). These may be
in use by employees of any of the above.

TOP SECRET STRAP 1

• Other / Unknown

Most of TDSD’s targeting effort is focussed on SIM suppliers and network operators, hence it
was expected that most associated addresses would fall into these categories.

Category	Associations
Hardware Companies	743
Mail Providers	298
Sim Suppliers	38
Network Operators	603
Other / Unknown	37

Table 2 - Types of organisations associated with IMSI/Ki traffic

Table 2 shows how often each type of organisation was associated with Ki traffic. Contrary to
expectation the vast majority of addresses seen belonged either to network operators or
hardware companies.

This could indicate increased use of strong encryption products amongst SIM suppliers,
leaving only the other groups open to this method of exploitation. TDSD may wish to ensure
that targeting for SIM suppliers is up to date, as well as investigating the possibility of
targeting hardware companies and network operators to improve results.

3.4	Comparison with present efforts

3.4.1 Manually collected Kis

A manual trawl of UDAQ data was performed against AWCC for the period between 28th
March and 10Lh April 2010. This was compared direcdy against results from an automated run
over the same period, not targeted against any particular provider.

In the manual trawl 14 UDAQ items were identified, all containing 1 or more IMSI/Ki pair
for AWCC. The automated run found 12 UDAQ items, 3 of which had been identified in the
manual trawl. A summary of results is shown in Table 3:

Table 3 - Results of Ki / IMSI trawl

The manual search resulted in a total of 27 IMSI values for AWCC. The automated search
resulted in 320 values, 26 of which were from the AWCC network. The automated methods
also identified 10 unique IMSIs from Roshan and 83 from MTN Yemen (results 3 and 23).

It can be seen that the automated search missed the majority of manually recovered items.
Reasons for this are noted in the comments column: in all cases the string IMSI did not appear
in the results file, hence these items were not returned in the initial bulk query. The majority
of these items also had IMSI and Ki data split across multiple lines, meaning they would not
have been identified by the detection techniques employed in this work in any case. Both
techniques found comparable quantities of IMSIs for AWCC with the result sets being mosdy
complimentary.

This has demonstrated that although the automated method is able to return a representative
set of items from bulk data, and often-larger volumes of Kis, it tended to miss items found
manually. More work is required both at the initial bulk query stage as well as with
processing and detection techniques.

3.4.2 Overall harvesting efforts

TDSD and OPC-CAP collect overall stats for Kis harvested from networks of interest
(reference 5). Overall rates of Kis received over a 3-month period, January - March 2010,
were compared against those from the automated technique. Figure 4 shows this comparison
for a range of networks.

New Kis identified

□	3 month total

□	Automated collection

Figure 4 - comparing data from the trial to historical data
(priority targets marked *)

The overall data set contains values gained from a range of sources including Ki generation
techniques and information sharing with partners.

It can be seen that for the first three providers; AWCC, Irancell and Roshan; the number of
keys collected by automated harvesting is comparatively small. Many of the larger batches of
Kis received in this period were provided by partners on request, and it is difficult to estimate
the real time period they were collected over. Additionally, the value of a small number of Kis
should not be underestimated as these can often be used as seeds to generate much larger
batches.

It is clear that the automated technique is able to identify Kis for a greater range of networks,
successfully identifying a large batch of Kis for a particular Somali provider.

This comparison did bring to light a number of networks where the C2C harvesting method is
not bringing results, notably the Pakistani networks Mobilink and Telenor for whom we do
have a store of Kis. There could be a number of explanations: it is possible that these

networks now use more secure methods to transfer Kis, or targeting for those networks might
be ineffective.

In summary, the automated technique is unlikely to bring in very large batches of Ki data of
the size produced with Ki generation schemes or received from partner repositories. However
it can bring in a steady stream of data over a period of time. These smaller volumes can fill
gaps where no other data is available, and also provide essential seed points from which Ki
generation can be applied.

4	Conclusions

This work has demonstrated that an automated method of Ki recovery, once in place, can
deliver significant results with little manual effort compared to current harvesting methods. In
addition to Ki harvesting a number of further applications have been demonstrated: the
monitoring of mobile network activity, where views have been provided over a 3-month
period; discovery of new target identifiers associated with detected traffic; and methods of
measuring the effectiveness of current techniques.

A picture of types of organisations associated with Ki traffic has been constructed providing a
new view of mobile network operations to TDSD.

It has also been shown that although the automated method is able to return a representative
set of items from bulk data, it often fails to detect all items that would be found manually.
More work is required at the initial bulk query stage and also with detection techniques to
ensure accurate and full coverage of Ki data.

Whilst problems have been identified such as limits on coverage due to access restrictions,
this work makes a strong case that such harvesting efforts will continue to deliver results in
TDSD and areas such as the CP SD team.

It is the author’s view that increased levels of corporate support for such bulk data processing
activities would allow TDSD, as well as many other business areas, to benefit from more
applications of these techniques.

4.1 Future Work

A number of items of follow-up work have been identified:

•	Improving initial query effectiveness

It has been shown that the initial base ‘proximity’ query is not effective enough to
return all results currently found using manual harvesting. Work should be carried
out to identify more effective queries to process data on. An alternative option is to
run the technique repeatedly against a number of result sets.

•	Improved detection techniques

Detection techniques are unable to identify Ki and IMSI data where the fields of
interest appear on separate lines (see section 3.4.2). An improved technique would
ensure these results are also detected and included.

•	Improved summary information

Summary information currendy consists of a list of email addresses, UDAQ item
identifiers and network codes associated with simple scores. Analysts would like to
be able to find the UDAQ item associated with a particular IMSI or email address
more easily. An improved scoring system would also help analysts more accurately

prioritise items found. Additionally, the accuracy of results could be improved by
detecting only IMSIs with vahd country and network codes.

•	Bulk access limitations

The maximum classification that can be returned from LLANDARCYPARK is TOP
SECRET STRAP2 UK Eyes Only. This limits access to some data likely to contain
IMSI and Ki values, such as password-recovered items. An improved system would
allow bulk access to the full range of data.

•	Adapting technique to be used for other key types

This technique currently identifies only IMSI and Ki values. In time it should be
extended to also support efforts against OTA keys, UMTS and more.

•	Data mining opportunities

Opportunities exist to mine bulk data produced during this process, potentially
detecting further items of interest and developing knowledge of targets involved.
Proposed ideas include detecting requests for batches of data by identifying
messages containing maximum and minimum SIM values.

•	Corporate support for bulk C2C processing

Access to ICTR’s bulk access capability is restricted to a small number of users,
however a number of business units have expressed an interest. This work should
continue to be used to develop requirements for a corporate solution allowing more
business units to benefit from these types of techniques.
