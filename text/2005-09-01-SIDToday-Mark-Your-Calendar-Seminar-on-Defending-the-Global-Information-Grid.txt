(U//FOUO) Mark Your Calendar: Seminar on Defending the Global
Information Grid
FROM: 
SINIO for Information Operations (S17)
Run Date: 09/01/2005
(C) The Global Information Grid (GIG), the DOD's worldwide computer network, is threatened by
hackers around the world on a constant basis. Most users who connect to the GIG are
conducting legitimate business.
(C) Unfortunately, a small group of users are not legitimate and intend to harm the US through
cyber exploitation of the GIG for criminal or foreign espionage purposes. The GIG exchanges
billions of data packets daily and detecting cyber intruders is literally a needle-in-a-haystack
problem.
(C) The responsibility of defending the GIG falls to USSTRATCOM and its cyber defense
command, Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO). The JTF-GNO directs the
operation and defense of the GIG to assure timely and secure net-centric capabilities in support
of the DOD mission. This seminar will review some of the most persistent and damaging cyber
intrusions against the GIG and will present the legal and technical issues associated with
warning, detection, identification, and attribution of the cyber intruders. The seminar speaker
will discuss NSA's unique contributions to JTF-GNO's current and proposed initiatives against
cyber intrusions and will submit intrusion data that indicates certain intrusion sets could be state
sponsored.
(U//FOUO) Mr. 
 is a senior intelligence analyst in JTF-GNO/J2 and will be
discussing the challenges of defending the GIG from nefarious hackers while permitting the
unhindered flow of information for legitimate purposes.
(U) The presentation will be held on 12 September 2005, from 1300-1500 in room
2B4118-6, OPS 2B.
(U) The classification level of this presentation is TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN and is open to
all NSA badgeholders. No need to register -- just show up!
