The position I<br>accepted was working in the Mission Operations Group (MOG) as a<br>Mission Planner. On a daily basis I influence the scheduling, live<br>execution, tasking and collection for a specific geographic area. It<br>has required that I expand my professional horizons, and has given<br>me the chance to regularly team with the operators and collection<br>managers who conduct the live mission as well as interact with the<br>SID organizations, the RSOCs and Intelligence Community<br>customers.<br>(U) While I have been very satisfied with the job here in Denver, I<br>have been at least as pleased with the living conditions in the area.<br>Denver's wonderful climate is a big contributor. Denver gets over<br>300 days of sunshine a year, which is more than any other U.S.<br>city except one. Thanks to the many days of sunshine and<br>extremely low humidity, those living in Colorado love taking<br>advantage of outdoor sporting activities. There are hundreds and<br>hundreds of miles of bicycle trails and walking paths all over the<br>metropolitan area. My family was pleasantly surprised to find a<br>path only about 100 yards from our house, which actually connects<br>with trails and paths that can take one to Denver International<br>Airport, approximately 35 miles away. Some of these trails can<br>also take one into the city as well as further into the suburbs. The<br>best part is that these trails are accessible nearly year round.<br>Having access to many state parks as well as national parks for<br>hiking and mountain climbing is another benefit to being in this<br>area.<br>(U) It would be an injustice to talk about a tour in Denver without<br>mentioning the mountains and opportunities to enjoy the winter<br>activities. One can drive to many of the ski resorts within one or<br>two hours or take the weekend ski train from downtown Denver.<br>The resorts provide many opportunities to ski, snowboard,<br>snowshoe, tube, ice skate and more. In fact for parents with<br>children in elementary school, field trips to take skiing or<br>snowboarding lessons are regularly offered when classes are not in<br>session. (Year-round schools are very popular here.) Finally I<br>should point out that Denver really does not get the snowfall that<br>many believe. Even though it frequently snows, it usually melts<br>within a day. The biggest snows come to the mountains, and<br>Denver is on the western edge of the Great Plains. The mammoth<br>snowfall (3-4 ft) we saw in 2003 was highly unusual and was<br>apparently the biggest since about 1913.<br>(U) The year round schools in the Denver area that I mentioned<br>earlier are actually only for elementary school students. There are<br>at least two excellent possibilities in the area, the Cherry Creek<br>Public Schools and Douglas County Public Schools. In addition to<br>traditional schools, both districts also offer options in charter<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.  Coming Soon: SID<br>Around the World!<br>2.

In addition to good<br>schools, finding that Denver had a higher locality pay than the<br>Baltimore-Washington area was a pleasant surprise. While housing<br>costs are higher in the Denver area than in Maryland, we were<br>pleased with the neighborhoods, communities, and selection of<br>housing available within a reasonable distance of the site at<br>Buckley Air Force Base.<br>(U) Well, it should be obvious by now that I can go on and on about<br>my experiences here. However I must come to a close. In sum I<br>will say, take a chance and try it out. A field tour may be more<br>than what you expected. The Denver field experience for my family<br>and me has truly exceeded our expectations.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are thinking of applying for a field position, see<br>the Extended Enterprise Vacancy Announcements .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
