(U) CHIPPEWA Moving Forward

(S//SI) CHIPPEWA, in its role as a 24/7 watch that continuously transfers high-priority traffic to
a key Third Party Partner, conducts a key operation in the NSA/CSS support to the Global War
on Terrorism (GWOT). Every day more than 40,000 raw material messages are sent or received
by this dedicated group of civilian and military mission managers. Nevertheless, for most of its
30-year history, almost every function was done manually. In just two short years, that situation
has been completely reversed.
(S//SI) Nearly every one of CHIPPEWA's systems and programs has been upgraded and
revamped to work faster and more efficiently. Central to this modernization process was the
installation of a T1 communication line in August 2004 and a second T1, which is currently
undergoing reliability testing. When both T1 lines are functioning, they will provide better
service and reliability to the customer and solve a long-standing message bottleneck problem.
Other upgrades include two new systems, which maintain the integrity of the traffic flow and
serve as an indicator if something goes wrong. In addition, almost all of CHIPPEWA's computers
have been upgraded to the more user-friendly NT model.
(S//SI) CHIPPEWA's modernization efforts have streamlined the process by which data is
transferred to the customer and greatly diminished the margin of operator error. Cumbersome
procedures that used to take 40 minutes of a message manager's time, now take 10
minutes. The result is the customer now receives near real-time delivery of data. A powerful
example of a modernization result can be seen by tracking the number of analytical messages
produced over the last three quarters: 140 (Oct-Dec), 219 (Jan- March), and 309(April-June).
This more than 100% increase represents not only greater efficiency, but also produces more
actionable intelligence that helps shape our response to the GWOT.
(U//FOUO) Automating this formerly labor-intensive operation has increased CHIPPEWA's
productivity and the maneuverability of its members throughout the organization, and provided
better, faster responses to our internal and external customers. As SRA
, CHIPPEWA
Team Leader, aptly observes, "From all the work involved in the CHIPPEWA modernization
effort, we have learned that taking time to save time can benefit the mission and possibly save
lives."
