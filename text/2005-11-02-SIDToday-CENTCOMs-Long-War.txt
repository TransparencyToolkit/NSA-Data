(U) CENTCOM's 'Long War'
FROM: 
CENTCOM Account Manager (S113)
Run Date: 11/02/2005

(C) In the last two installments, we examined CENTCOM's
requirements on the SIGINT system, and our response. Today's
topic is CENTCOM's Long War - and what it will require of
NSA/CSS.
(U) Supporting the Long War
(S//REL) In March 2005, the Commander of CENTCOM, GEN John
P. Abizaid, unveiled his plans to fight extremism and instability in
the CENTCOM region (East Africa, Middle East, Levant, Central
Asia) over the next few years in a presentation titled: "Bold Shift
2005: Posturing for the Long War." CENTCOM is preparing for US
force reductions in the region, transitioning operations to partner
nations and indigenous forces, and improving target development
and intelligence fusion capabilities through better partnering with
other US government agencies, coalition members, and regional
governments.
(S//REL) The principles he laid out are:
Use the indirect approach; help others help themselves.
Avoid dependency syndrome: promote self-reliant partners.
Remove perception of occupation: we have no designs on
territories or resources.
Enable moderates.
(S//SI//REL) The following summarizes part of CENTCOM's vision
for the future, and shows expected impacts to NSA/CSS:

(U//FOUO) In the coming years, SIGINT support to CENTCOM will
change to fit CENTCOM's changing requirements. As ever,
NSA/CSS will place priority on support to the warfighter and
optimizing mission success. Throughout the SIGINT system, we will
strive to anticipate CENTCOM's needs and ensure that we deliver
the right information and capabilities to them, on time and in the
right manner.
