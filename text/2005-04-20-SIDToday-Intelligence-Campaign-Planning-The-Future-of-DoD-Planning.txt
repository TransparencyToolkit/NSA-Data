(U//FOUO) Intelligence Campaign Planning: The Future of DoD
Planning

New intelligence campaign planning to affect NSA (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) Historically, deliberate planning for possible contingencies were developed primarily
in peacetime and relied on assumptions regarding political and military circumstances that would
be in existence upon implementation. The deliberate planning process was highly structured and
resulted in fully coordinated, complex planning for all contingencies and the transition to and
from war. However, the process was measured in years to completion. During both OEF and
OIF* this planning methodology proved ill-suited for modern operations.
(U//FOUO) Now a new Intelligence Campaign Planning (ICP) process -- a comprehensive
methodology for integrating intelligence into operations planning -- is being established. What
will it mean for the NSA/CSS Extended Enterprise?
1.  (S) The capabilities of NSA/CSS will be integrated into each Combatant Command's
(COCOM) plan as it is being built - not after the fact.
2.  (U//FOUO) NSA/CSS will build a support plan in conjunction with the rest of the
intelligence community -- not in isolation.
3.  (S) The NSA/CSS support plan will be much more detailed and comprehensive than plans
in the past and therefore, for the duration of planning, NSA offices will be asked to
commit significant resources to complete the plan.
4.  (U//FOUO) The plan will be signed by the Director and will be presented to the COCOM,
Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD/I) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
(U) Background - How This Came About
(U//FOUO) In response to the shortcomings of the old process, the USD/I directed a study in
2003 (Taking Stock of Defense Intelligence Assessment - TSDI) baselining the Combatant
Commands' and Services' intelligence needs. This study revealed that planning for intelligence
operations and activities was:
not synchronized or proactive;
inadequate for the effective use of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR);
incomplete and focused heavily on targeting; and
is sometimes joint, but rarely combined.
(U//FOUO) A specific finding of the study was that the COCOMs do not include the Combat
Support Agencies (CSA), of which NSA is one, in the planning process early enough to ensure
timely and adequate support. To address this issue, the study team identified the need for:
1.  A synchronization plan that brings together the DoD and Intelligence Community (IC)
capabilities in a synergistic effort, answering the intelligence needs of the commander
and his staff
2.  A plan to integrate critical ISR assets required from Services, Service components in
other theaters, national agencies, allies and coalition partners
3.  Federated production support required from CSAs, Service intelligence centers, and

 COCOM Joint Intelligence/Analysis Centers (JICs/JAC) in other theaters
4.  A plan for linguistics and reserve augmentation
(U//FOUO) The next Contingency Planning Guidance (CPG) will further facilitate the DoD's shift
to a compressed, iterative process, to be known as the Adaptive Planning Process (APP). The
goal of adaptive planning is to produce and iterate flexible options that anticipate and respond
rapidly to changing conditions -- producing plans rapidly and allowing for existing plans to be
updated in months, not years.
