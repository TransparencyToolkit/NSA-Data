(S//REL) Going After al-Qa'ida - All of It
FROM:
NSA Liaison Officer to SOCOM (F1T)
Run Date: 12/06/2005

(S//REL) The War on Terrorism is now focused on the whole al-Qa'ida Network, not just its
leaders.
(S//REL) In July 2005 the Secretary of Defense signed an Execute Order directing DOD to plan
and conduct operations to defeat the al-Qa'ida network. This EXORD broadened ongoing War on
Terrorism (WOT) efforts from their narrow focus on al-Qa'ida senior leadership to encompass a
target set comprised of the entire al-Qa'ida Network (defined as the grouping of like-minded
Sunni extremists who interact, share resources and work -- together and/or independently -toward shared extremist goals).
(S//REL) Commonly referred to as the AQN EXORD (al-Qa'ida Network Execute Order), the order
granted the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) "the authority to direct
the actions of DOD participants related to planning, priorities, force selection, and mission
activities that are part of the campaign to defeat the (AQN)." USSOCOM's role is not to execute
specific actions. Rather, it is to arrange plans and decide on the sequencing of actions by
Combatant Commanders, Combat Support Agencies (such as NSA), other government agencies
and U.S. allies to achieve WOT campaign objectives.
(S//REL) The EXORD directs DOD to deny the AQN access to the "system of systems" it needs to
survive and operate successfully:
Leadership 
Funds 
Weapons, including WMD/WME** 
Safe havens 
Communications and movement 
Ideological support 
Foot soldiers (recruits) 
Access to targets 
Links to supporting governments
