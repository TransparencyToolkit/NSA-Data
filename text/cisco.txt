Programs Affected:

Udate software on all Cisco Optical Network Switches.

All of our Cisco ONS SONET multiplexers are experiencing a software bug
that causes them to intermittently drop out.

The mission impact is unknown. While the existing bug doesn't appear to
affect traffic, applying the new software update could. Unfortunately, there is
now way to be sure. We can't simulate the bug in our lab and so it's
impossible to predict exactly what will happen when we apply the software
update. We propose to update one of the nodes in NBP-320 ?rst to determine
ifthe update goes smoothly.

Recently we tried to reset the standby manager card in the HOMEMAKER
node. When that failed, we attempted to physically reseat it. Since it was the
standby card, we did not expect that would cause any problems. However,
upon reseating the card, the entire ONS crashed and we lost all traffic through
the box. It took more than an hour to recover from this failure.

The worst case scenario is that we have to blow away the entire con?guration
and start from scratch. Prior to starting our upgrade, we will save the
configuration so that if we have to configure the box from scratch, we can
simply uploade the saved configuration. We estimate that we will be down for
no more than an hour for each node in the system.

We have tested the upgrade in our lab and it works well. However, we can't
repeat the bug in our lab, so we don't know if we will encounter problems when
we attempt to upgrade a node that is affected by the bug.
