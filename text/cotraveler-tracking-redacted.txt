Introduction

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) This short-term study overviews and documents key elements of the co-traveler
analytics both under development and operational at NSA. Each section includes a brief description of
the analytic, its status, source data, and caveats.

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) While each analytic was designed to operate on a particular type of data or a
particular data format, many can likely be scaled to operate on other data sources. For instance,
analytics designed for DNR GCID or VLR data might also apply to DNI Geolocation data.

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The process of documenting these analytics raised a series of important issues
that not only distinguish the analytics from each other, but more importantly, shape the landscape
that we must consider in moving forward to meet the analytic needs at NSA. Some of these issues are
discussed in the next section.

Issues and Questions

Should a co-travel analytic consider where a GCID or VLR is physically located?

o Many GSM analytics use GCID information to identify co-travelers. If two selectors are seen
at the same GCID around the same time, they are considered co-travel candidates. The
analytic does not need to know where the GCID is physically located. However, if the
individuals are using different network providers (e.g., T-Mobile and Verizon), they may be
physically standing next to each other as their mobiles register with different cell towers.
Co-travel analytics that do not consider the physical geo-locations of the towers will not
discover individuals that are co-traveling on different networks.
o Analytics that make use of point data (e.g., Thuraya) necessarily need to consider
geolocational data in order to determine distance from one point to another.

Should incidental co-travelers be considered?

o There is a difference between incidental co-travel due to collective movement (individuals
with similar travel behaviors but no other similarities) and functional group-based co-travel
among individuals with behaviorally relevant relationships. CTCOP makes this definition
explicit, but warns that we might not want to exclude seemingly incidental co-travelers
simply because we are unaware of their relationship.
o Other factors, such as contact chains and target COMSEC behaviors (frequent power-down,
handset swapping, SMS behavior), might assist in determining whether co-travelers are
associated through their travel behaviors alone or through behaviorally relevant
relationships.

Should geography play a role in co-travel?

o Because it is difficult to know where a GSM target is located within a GCID or VLR, many of
the GSM co-travel analytics use the mathematical central point in the VLR or GCID as a
reference point. We could postulate that traveling targets will be located along roads, train
tracks, or footpaths where network service exists. This type of geographical information
could theoretically be used to inform a co-traveler analytic in identifying candidates
(especially those that are traveling via the same means of transportation). Geographical
information might also be used to "fill in the gaps" when data is missing between locations
that a target visited.

o Analytics in this study that make use of such geographical information include DSD's Co-
travel analytic and the Geospatial Analysis Tradecraft Center's (GATC's) Opportunity Volume
analytic.

Should device and collection sampling play a role in determining co-travelers?

o We may collect hundreds of events from one target's mobile phone while collecting only a
few events from his co-traveler's mobile phone. The number of events collected may be due
to collection bias, differences in network service, and/or target COMSEC behavior. Analytics
should take these considerations into account when attempting to identify co-travelers.

travelers seen in different source databases be considered?

Depending on a target's preferred communication behaviors, some co-travelers may be
seen largely in DNR GSM data, and other co-travelers may be seen largely in DNI data. We
may be able to construct a more complete picture of a target's locations over time if we
combine DNR and DNI data sources. It might be worth considering the degree to which
considering multiple data sources will significantly increase the number of false positives.
Databases that do not contain geolocation information might also be considered. For
instance, air travelers on the same reservation number are probably co-traveling on the
same flight. Users sharing a MAC address are probably co-located using the same device
even though we may not know where that device is located. Consistent observations of
devices within the same LAIC may provide evidence of co-location, even if the LAIC's
physical service area is unknown. Finally, similarities between IP addresses may indicate
proximity on the same LAN, even if the physical location of the LAN nodes is unknown.

The one analytic in this study that attempts to combine multiple sources of information to
build a more holistic picture of a target's travel pattern is the TAC/Cafe/TMAC Co-travel
analytic.

Can co-travel be considered a series of meetings?

o We attempted to limit this study to targets co-traveling through two or more locations

within an analyst-specified time and space window. If those locations are defined, however,
we might consider co-travel as a series of "meetings" at known locations. Analytics that
detect co-location may be different in nature from those that detect co-travel. The specific
analytic need will define which of these approaches is more appropriate and efficient.

Analytics

CHALKFUN

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Chalkfun's Co-Travel analytic computes the date, time, and network location
of a mobile phone over a given time period, and then looks for other mobile phones that were seen in
the same network locations around a one hour time window. When a selector was seen at the same
location (e.g., VLR) during the time window, the algorithm will reduce processing time by choosing a few
events to match over the time period. Chalkfun is SPCMA enabled1.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Note: As of 6 September 2012, the events that are chosen depend on the
"sampling method" chosen by the analyst (most active, most per day, first/last/most, or
first/last/spread). The "sampling rate" specifies how many events are chosen to match. As Chalkfun
moves to the cloud, this option will be discontinued.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The cloud-based version of Chalkfun (see R6 SORTINGLEAD Co-traveler
Analytic section), which may be released as early as September 2012, will have a number of additional
features and options:

•	The system will run one query (rather than separate queries) for all of the IMSIs, MSISDNs, VLRs,
and GCIDs that an analyst enters (as if the selectors and areas of interest were joined with an
"OR"). The system currently runs separate queries for each, returning separate sets of results for
each combination of selector and areas of interest. The cloud-based version will also enable the
user to set the size of the time window that the analytic considers, rather than defaulting to one
hour (as described above).

•	The user will be able to choose the countries or locations of interest. Blacklist and whitelist

features will enable the user to instruct the system to ignore activity within a region, or restrict
analysis to specified regions of interest (e.g., ignore activity in	or use only activity from

)

•	In considering potential co-travelers, the analyst will have the option to ignore activity in which
the target is in his home country

1 (S//SI//REL) SPCMA enables the analytic to chain "from," "through," or "to" communications metadata fields
without regard to the nationality or location of the communicants, and users may view those same
communications metadata fields in an unmasked form.

• The analyst will be able to filter in or out potential co-travelers with specified prefixes (for

instance, return only	mobiles, remove all	mobiles, them, or include only mobiles

that are from the same country as the target).

DSD Co-Travel Analytic

Background

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DSD Co-Travel analytic predicts target locations and co-travelers by
calculating time-based travel trajectories. Probable travel routes are calculated using observed locations
and determining the most likely paths and travel times similar to that used in turn-by-turn navigation
systems. These target travel paths are represented as a series of LAT/LONG waypoints or line segments
along the probable travel routes, such as roads. The travel paths are divided into segments (e.g. 20 to
50km along the road). The analytic predicts the approximate time that the target would theoretically
arrive at each segment waypoint based on projected travel times between known locations. Then,
within the travel window, the analytic discovers candidate co-travellers that intersect locations along
the buffered travel path. The next step in the analytic is performed using interactive Renoir analysis of a
two mode graph representing the route segments and selectors observed on these route segments
within the time windows. Once the data is clean and candidate co-travellers are identified detailed
analysis can be done in Renoir or other tools such as GeoTime incorporating other supporting data such
as communications events and content.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic currently runs on a Netezza-based architecture, called Hectic
Snare, that rapidly executes MySQL-based QFDs. This architecture enables interactive exploratory
analysis and rapid pattern matching. The analytic is distributable and could be implemented in
Hadoop/MapReduce or Accumulo.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic was tested using an	terrorist case study. The case

study used approximately 80,000 base stations locations and 16 billion mobiles location records for
CDRs (Call detail records) and infrastructure collect from DRT and Juggernaut systems. This case study
showed that more candidate co-travellers were discovered by analyzing the travel paths than by
considering common meeting locations alone.

Future Work

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) DSD would like to integrate key meeting locations into this analytic, such as
safehouses. Plans are also underway to identify targets based on COMSEC behaviors such as identifying
mobiles that are turned off right before convergence between two travel paths occurs.

Geospatial Analysis Tradecraft Center (GATC) Opportunity Volume
Analytic

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The opportunity volume analytic determines whether two entities (e.g.
devices) could have been co-located by considering the possibility of their travel paths intersecting. The
opportunity volume analytic requires pairs of event locations and times for each entity, and computes
the possible locations and times in which the two entities could have been co-located. It does this by
computing possible travel route surfaces for each entity between the specified events, using a travel
cost surface computed from terrain, land cover, and road network data. These possible travel route
surfaces include the temporal dimension (that is, the period of time in which the entity could have been
at the given location); the intersection between these multidimensional surfaces represents the places
and times during which the entities could have been co-located. The analytic was developed using GPS
point event data, but the analytic actually uses a 1-km grid for the spatial resolution and a 15-minute
period for the temporal resolution, so it can be applied to any data that can be expressed in these
terms.

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

Future Work

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The purpose of this service is to determine whether two entities could have
been co-located given observed event locations for those entities. To detect co-travel, the analyst would
need to define a series of meeting locations and times. The opportunity volume analytic could also
provide a mechanism for vetting co-travel analytics by testing for possible co-location events along co-
travel routes.

TMI Co-Traveler Analytic

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The	Track Mutual Information (TMI) cloud analytic

was developed as a study under their graph analytics, alerting, and target development program. The
analytic is oriented to work on 7 to 30 days worth of regional collection. It has been tested on RT-RG
data from the	region. Instead of using GCID information as co-travel reference points, the

analytic works cross-network by computing target "closeness" based on the GCID Lat/Long GEO
information and time. The Lat/Long information is obtained from RT-RG.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic starts by computing event sequences of LAT, LONG, and time for
each selector. These are called "tracks". It then computes a value that measures how far the selector
has traveled in general. If the selector has not traveled outside a 20 to 50 km radius, the selector is not
considered. Each eligible selector's tracks are pairwise-compared to the others and a measure of
similarity in time and space is computed.

Future Work

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) | would like to reduce processing by creating an index containing selectors
whose tracks are near each other in space. To achieve this, future work may make use of a GEOAddress
hashing algorithm that uses LAT/LONG information to group cell towers into clusters that are in the
same region. This hash considers latitude and longitude only, and is agnostic to the targets' service
provider. It may be possible to also compare target tracks quickly by comparing these GeoAddresses.

Co-Traveler Analytics

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY)	has developed two co-travel analytics: Fast Follower (FF) and

Meet&Greet Spatial Chaining (MGSC). The FF analytic was initially designed to detect individuals who
are following station personnel. Detailed non-SIGINT path data is collected consensually on the station
personnel, and this reference path data provides the seeds for this analytic, which attempts to discover
mobile GEO data indicating individuals that may be following the station personnel. The MGSC analytic
is designed to detect meetings between high-value individuals and other entities.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The FF analytic begins by considering non-SIGINT reference paths for station
personnel based on detailed knowledge of the entity's location. Candidate followers are determined by
identifying other individuals that have traversed some number of consecutive points (determined by the
analyst) that match the reference path in space and time. The analyst also sets a parameter to specify
the minimum distance that must be covered along a candidate path.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The MGSC analytic is designed for ELKPRINTS data from smartphones. This
analytic identifies sequences of consecutive location points close in time and combines them into a
single data point. A maximum velocity movement parameter is applied to create a time window around
each point representing the approximate time at which the individual was located there (as opposed to
traveling to or from that location). Finally, co-travelers are identified by discovering pairs of selectors
that meet the duration and distance thresholds set by the analyst as input parameters. Spatial chaining
software aggregates and presents the meeting data, including the locations, times, and scoring metrics
to the analyst.

PACT NGA-NSA GATC Analytic

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The PACT analytic is a joint NSA-NGA effort to identify co-traveling Thuraya
handsets. The effort was motivated by an increase in Thuraya phone usage by

SIGINT Geospatial Analysts were able to characterize the travel

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

behaviors of the targeted Thuraya handsets and identifying other handsets with similar patterns. The
targeted handsets were observed traveling between known	government and military

installations; therefore, handsets with similar travel behaviors were inferred to be	government

forces.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The first step of PACT is to identify a set of waypoints for each target handset.
Waypoints are generated from sequences of events that cluster together in space and time. The second
step is to identify which pairs of handsets contain similar waypoint clusters. Pairs are scored based on
the number of waypoint clusters that match. This analytic also considers the total possible number of
waypoint clusters for each selector, so that the total number of communication events per selector is
taken into consideration. This process is intended to reduce the possibility of producing results that
include incidental co-travel. The third step in this analytic identifies persistent patterns by examining the
time periods over which co-location occurs for each co-travel candidate pair.

Future Work

Future work could involve applying this analytic to other types of QFD datasets such as Inmarsat and
GSM data. The team is also interested in building on this analytic to enable discovery of asynchronous
co-traveling relationships.

R6 SORTINGLEAD Co-Traveler Analytic

Background

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) R6 has been partnering with Chalkfun to upgrade the Chalkfun co-traveler
analytic to a cloud-based analytic that will run on Cloud 14 (to eventually be migrated to MDR-2).

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The R6 co-traveler analytic accepts a selector and timeframe as input, and
then derives an itinerary for the selector that includes the CELL IDs and/or VLRs (depending on what is
available). The itinerary is based on a series of waypoints generated from the location information that
is available in FASCIA-PCS. Then, the analytic searches for other selectors that were "near" these
waypoints in space and time. Time windows are configurable and can be adjusted by the user. Each
candidate is scored and then prioritized based on the scores.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The R6 co-traveler analytic operates on Sortinglead Event Summaries and a
GEO Index. The Sortinglead Event Summaries provide rapid access to FASCIA PCS events by summarizing

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

10

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL TO USA, FVEY

and enriching key elements of selector behavior. The Sortinglead Event Summaries benefit this analytic
because they can provide enriched location information about selectors that is not present in the raw
metadata. The GEO Index contains a mapping between the locations (GCIDs or VLRs) visited by a
selector and the time (day/minute) that the visit(s) occurred. Information from command and control
networks that track IED attacks is also used to enrich the GEO Index.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The results that can be returned from this type of analytic can potentially be
enormous. Each candidate will have some level of time and space overlap with the seed. Prioritization
occurs by assessing the quality of the overlap in terms of time and space closeness. The analyst may
choose to triage any number of potential candidates (e.g. top 10 or top 100 candidates, or candidates
that surpass a given threshold).

instance, analytic will not be

multiple countries and large time
frames (e.g., anywhere in

over the past year and then
anywhere in ^^^|).

Future Work

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Because the R6 co-traveler analytic depends on GCID and VLR locations as
meeting points or waypoints, it will not return selectors that co-travel on different provider networks.
(For instance, it could not return a Verizon selector co-traveling with a T-Mobile selector.) The R6 team
is working on experiments that might "alias" seed selectors to nearby selectors on other networks to get
around this problem, but this poses challenges. The RT-RG analytic (discussed later in this paper) uses
relative velocities to deal with the cross-network challenge, but this approach requires pre-computing
travel behavior for all pairs of selectors, which can be computationally expensive.

RT-RG Sidekicks

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The RT-RG Sidekick Cloud-Based Co-traveler analytic compares average travel
velocity between pairs of selectors to infer whether or not could co-travel would practically be possible.
The velocity factor is intended to reduce the number of false positives when considering travel among
urban areas by filtering out pairs of selectors that were seen at the same series of CELL IDs or VLRs over
time, but could not have been traveling together because the location data timestamps presuppose an
unreasonable velocity. This may happen because one or both of the selectors in the pair may have been
located at the edges of the network coverage during one or more of their travel midpoints.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The analytic first computes "movement summaries" of all available tasked
selectors. The movement summaries contain a list of locations that a target visited during the timeframe
of interest, given by the analyst. Locations are defined by CELL IDs (for GSM) or GEO-Hashes (for
any other selectors with Lat/Long). Then, the system discovers pairs of targets that could be traveling
together by comparing their sequences of physical locations and factoring out pairs that could not have
reasonably arrived at the meeting waypoints within 10 minutes of each other.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) One of the main benefits of the RT-RG Sidekicks analytic is that it is not
constrained by provider network. Because it considers physical (LAT/LONG) locations and travel
velocities, it can provide co-traveler results that include selectors on different provider networks.

Scalable Analytics Tradecraft Center (SATC) Geospatial Lifelines Co-
Travel QFD

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines QFD applies the concept of "dwell times" to identify
DNR co-travelers. Dwell times describe the time period spent at the beginning or ending destination. A
location is considered a beginning or ending location if the dwell time at that location is greater than 2
hours.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This QFD first generates geohashes using GSM event data, and then
calculates transition lines indicating that a device traveled from one geohash to another. The result is a
graph in which the geohashes represent nodes and the transitions represent links or edges. Clustering
algorithms are applied to the graphs to determine locations and selectors of interest.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The geospatial lifelines represent the beginning and ending locations, as
defined by their dwell times, and all other intermediate observations. The likeliness of co-travel along
paths between starting and destination points is based on the following measurements: net distance,
time of transition (mins), speed (kph), Azimuth, and number of travel segments.

SSG Common IMSIs Analytic

(S//SI//REL) The Common IMSIs Analytic is a model in SEDB JEMA finds SIM card activity seen on cell
tower panels in multiple areas (e.g.- border crossings commonly used by traffickers). It makes use of the

that tower locations in OCTSKYWARD can be imprecise. Also, the SEDB Tower QFD summarizes IMSIs by

(TMAC) DNI Co-Travel Analytic

Café Spin 1 (October 2011 - January 2012)

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The Café project involved TMAC, SSG, T1212, and S2I5 working in concert to
develop both DNI and DNR cloud-based travel analytics. The absence of a cloud-based solution that
could run over bulk data motivated this initiative. The Café objective was to steer cloud travel analytics
toward operational use and ultimately merge the DNI and DNR analytics in a unified co-travel analytic.
These analytics are currently still under development; however, they are available to the development
community on GM-PLACE.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) This analytic uses IP geolocation of active user/presence events as travel
indication.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DNI analytic operates in one of two modes. The first mode accepts a list
of tasked targets via UTT, and attempts to identify co-travelers for those targets that have been deemed
to have travelled during a specified time window (typically 30 days). The analytic only considers targets
that traveled between at least 2 countries in a given month. For these traveling targets, candidate co-
travelers are scored based on how many times they were seen in the same locations during the same
times as the target. Target locations are given by DNI selector IP geolocation, provided by ASDF enriched

with GEO reference data (or geo-tagging where available). Because this data provides city-level location
resolution, co-traveler candidates are assigned scores based on the extent to which they were seen in
the same cities and on the same days as targets.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The second mode accepts a pattern representing target travel across
spanning countries of interest (e.g.,	and optionally, the days on which the countries

were visited. In this mode, the TAC/Cafe/TMAC DNI Co-travel analytic in this mode identifies travelers
that (at minimum) match the pattern. All candidates that match the pattern are regarded as possible
co-travelers.

(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) The result of these analytics is a QFD monthly roll-up that can be queried.

Background

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The Café project involved TMAC, SSG, T1212, and S2I5 working in concert to
develop both DNI and DNR cloud-based travel analytics. The absence of a cloud-based solution that
could run over bulk data motivated this initiative. The Café objective was to merge the DNI and DNR
analytics to create one complete co-travel analytic; however the DNR co-traveler analytic, described
below, is currently still under development.

(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The DNR cloud-based analytic considers all known targets (tasked in OCTAVE)
that have traveled within a given date range (e.g., monthly roll-up to five month range), and attempts to
find their co-travelers. Co-travelers are defined as individuals that were seen in the same area (currently
defined by VLRs) around the same time as the targets. The output includes both tasked and untasked
selectors as possible co-travelers with the tasked seeds. Each possible co-traveler is assigned a score
that indicates the probability of co-travel with the seed. Higher scores are assigned to co-travelers that
are seen at more of the same locations and closer in time (pairs are given one point if seen within one
hour, and a half point if seen within two hours of each other).

Status and Summary

Future Work

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Follow-on analysis could take advantage of FASTSCOPE reservation number
feature which will return all co-travelers that travel on the same reservation number within a given time
period (because reservation numbers are reused, a specific timeframe must be provided).

Summary

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) At the beginning of this paper, we presented a number of key issues and
questions. Many of the analytics define themselves by (1) the key issues they address in novel ways and
(2) the types of source data on which they operate.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The key issues section highlights capabilities that might improve the accuracy
of the analytic results. For example, analytics that have knowledge about the locations of GCIDs and
VLRs and can augment their procedures with non-SIGINT data such as geographic and terrestrial data.
This information contains knowledge about the locations of highways and roads. Analytics that can
geographically validate routes between meeting points can then use this information to constrain the
possible co-travel routes and candidate co-travel selectors along those routes.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) Analytics that can operate on a variety of different source data formats,
including both DNI and DNR, benefit from the ability to exploit divergent data sources to develop more
complete pictures of target travel behavior.

(S//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY) The co-travel analytics in this study are at various stages of development,
testing, and deployment. One possible way forward could be to have an independent organization2
perform a formal evaluation of these analytics using a common test dataset. This would enable a fair
comparison and assessment of the analytics' processing time, efficiency, and accuracy. Understanding
the advantages and challenges of each analytic against a common test dataset with ground truth may
facilitate planning for future work.

2 An independent organization is one that is not involved in the development of any of these analytics and that
does not have a stake in the outcome.

RT-RG Sidekicks	(TS//SI/REL TO USA, FVEY). This analytic computes "movement summaries" of tasked selectors. These are lists of locations that a target visited during the timeframe of interest. Then, the system discovers pairs of targets that could be traveling together by comparing their movement summaries, factoring out pairs that could not have reasonably arrived at the meeting waypoints within 10 minutes of each other.
