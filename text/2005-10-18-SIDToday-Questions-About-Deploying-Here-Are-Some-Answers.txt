course that covers general culture issues, customs and courtesies.
(U) What does deployment to a CST do to my career progression?
(S//REL) It gives a person a thorough understanding of how tactical SIGINT supports the
war fighter in a joint environment - this is great experience for many SIGINT jobs.

months?
