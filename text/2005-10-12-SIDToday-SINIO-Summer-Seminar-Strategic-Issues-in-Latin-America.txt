Course Overview:
(U//FOUO) Many of the challenges facing Latin America today have significant long-term
implications for U.S. interests. Will Venezuela remain a significant source of oil for the United
States? What are the implications of having Chavez as Castro's ideological successor? Does the
recent trend of electing socialist leaders in South American countries represent an irreconcilable
difference with the United States? Will it adversely impact economic relations? Does the rise in
populist movements in Central and South America herald a regionalization of the FARC/ELN
insurgencies? Assuming success in Colombia, how will narcotics trafficking in the Andean region
change? China has become greatly engaged in Latin America -- what are the potential
ramifications to U.S. influence in the region?
