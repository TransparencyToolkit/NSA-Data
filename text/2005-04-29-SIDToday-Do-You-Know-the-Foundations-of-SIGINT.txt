(U//FOUO) Have you ever needed easy access to a SIGINT overview? Did you ever try to explain
the National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) to a non-SIGINTer? Wouldn't it be terrific if
this type of information were easily available on NSANet, INTELINK and SIPRNet? Well, your
wish is our command!
(U//FOUO) Customer Gateway (S11) is pleased to announce Foundations of SIGINT , an on-line
orientation that provides a broad overview of the U.S. SIGINT System for those who have little
or no experience with SIGINT and/or the National Security Agency. This resource, designed at
the SECRET level to provide a basic concept of SIGINT, includes an overview of NSA and
modules on Customer Relations, Customer Needs, Products and Services, Information Networks
and Legal Policies.
(U//FOUO) Foundations of SIGINT is available as follows:
On NSANet: 
On Intelink:
On SIPRNet: 
A PowerPoint version that can be used as briefing material is available in the on-line S11
Library or directly at: 
(U//FOUO) We originally started this effort as a means of enhancing training for new FBI analysts
at Quantico but immediately recognized the benefits for other customers, CSG personnel, NSA
employees, etc. So, the next time you need immediate access to a SIGINT Glossary or a quick
overview on Write-to-Release, check out Foundations of SIGINT . And stay tuned for further
releases as we begin expanding some of the modules.
