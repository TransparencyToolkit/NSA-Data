(U//FOUO) All EYES on the Counterintelligence Conference
FROM: Mary Jo Coyner
Production Manager, Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support (S2D)
Run Date: 03/25/2005

Second annual 5-EYES Counterintelligence Conference was held 1 and 2 March in Cheltenham,
England (U//FOUO)
(TS//SI) The theme of the conference, jointly hosted by NSA and GCHQ*, was "Towards a Joint
Understanding of Counterintelligence -- Forging Common Ground and Partnerships." Participants
in the conference held true to realizing the theme as each of the five partners were prepared for
substantive and honest discussions about their respective CI programs, a marked change from
the first conference which was held here at NSA last April and could best be described as
exploratory.
(U//FOUO) I led the NSA delegation and was accompanied by 
 and
 from my Product Line,
 from the NSACC*, and
 from FAD*.

from the NTOC*, 

(TS//SI) Below please find a short summary of the conference which was prepared by 
, my counterpart at GCHQ, and which she shared with her senior leadership. From my
perspective, the conference was truly a success and we look forward to following through with
the actions that were derived from the conference, as well as looking for other opportunities to
collaborate on the CI topic.
Short summary from GCHQ (U)
(TS//SI) It was heartening to see how the levels of commitment from the non-UK/US partners
had raised considerably since last year with significant signs of topic maturity shown by agency
representatives, in particular, CSE (Canada's Communications Security Establishment).
(TS//SI) A well-pitched and informative keynote address by SIS (the British Security Intelligence
Service) provided clarification of HUMINT requirements from SIGINT and set just the right scene
for cross-partner discussion.
(TS//SI) The range of traditional CI topics discussed was extended to include a half-day briefing
on how Electronic Attack is viewed and worked in each agency -- a good airing for the
SIGINT/Information Assurance hinge.
(TS//SI) There were several joint actions agreed by the 5 partners -- all of which will be worked
via the newly established Collaboration Working Group. These focus on:
1.  Producing a matrix to show where we have overlap and underlap of National
Requirements.
2.  Reviewing the ECI (Exceptionally Controlled Information) associated with CI work with a
goal of coming to a mutual understanding and application across the 5 agencies, and the
possibility of including some Electronic Attack casework.
3.  Sharing language assets and intelligence analysts.
4.  Working towards a common understanding in our CI relationships with Third Parties (the
Crown Jewels concept).
(U//FOUO) Two partners offered to host next year's Conference -- NZ and Canada -- it was
agreed (amicably) that CSE should host.
