It has certainly seemed that way for me in my three short years as an NSA employee.<br>But, for many of us, our coworkers actually are our family, too. In my case, my father has been<br>an agency employee for the past 30+ years. Although I started out believing my situation to be<br>a rather unusual one, I've come to realize that this is much more prevalent than I once thought.<br>(U) NSA has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, even though my dad was<br>never able to share any details about what he did for a living. When I was very young, and<br>asked him why there were giant golf balls on top of the building, he told me that it was because<br>he worked in a golf ball factory. I can't believe I fell for that one! Now that I've been hired by the<br>agency, I have a more accurate understanding of the world to which my father disappeared<br>every day and what actually goes on behind those reflective windows of the headquarters<br>building.<br>(U) When I started my career, I often wondered what people would think if they found out my<br>"family secret" - that my dad worked at the agency, too. What a surprise it was to find out from<br>practically day one that so many other employees are related to one another, too! It became<br>something of interest to me to take note of how many husband and wives, sisters and brothers,<br>children and parents, etc. actually are employed by NSA. One coworker's father, mother, stepfather and brother all work at the Agency.<br>(U) After celebrating NSA's 50th Anniversary, I have realized that not only does NSA have a long<br>and proud history, but also that my family is a part of that history. I'll never grow tired of the<br>"Are you any relation to .......?" question because I realize there is a legacy to carry on. And<br>someday I may also be able to proudly tell my children, "It's because I work in a golf ball<br>factory."<br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Are you also part of a multi-generational NSA<br>family?
