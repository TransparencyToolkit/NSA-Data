When : 14 September, 0800-0930 
Where : room 3W037-2, OPS1
(U) The Trojan War, the Normandy invasion during WWII, Operation Desert Storm, and
Operation Iraqi Freedom all share a common feature: the battle took place in the adversary's
mind as well as on the ground. Perception management, the art of manipulating an adversary's
understanding of their environment, is a critical and powerful tool that, when used effectively,
can deliver a blow just as devastating as a B-52 strike. Crafting an effective perception
management strategy is an art as well as a science and hinges on the planner's clear
understanding of the adversary's perception of their environment in order to convince them to
act in a way that benefits US objectives.
(C) This seminar will discuss the key perception management principals and concepts
(to include potential targets, messages, delivery methods, and feedback) and the role SIGINT
can play in the process by identifying potential targets and communication patterns,
monitoring perception management messages, reporting on the audience reaction to the
message, and being alert for unanticipated reactions to the message. Case studies from recent
conflicts will be presented that highlight classic perception management techniques and their
success (or failure) in supporting the overall combat objectives.
(U//FOUO) The seminar speaker, Mr. Robert Trantin, is a senior IO planner with the 1st IO
(Information Operations) Command, Ft. Belvoir, and is a former lecturer on Psychological
Operations (PSYOPS) and perception management techniques at the Joint Forces Staff College.
(U) The classification level of this presentation is TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN and is open to
all NSA badgeholders. Registration is not required -- just show up!
