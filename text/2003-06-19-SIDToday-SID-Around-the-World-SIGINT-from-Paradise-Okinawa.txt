DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Around the World: SIGINT from Paradise (Okinawa)<br>FROM: <br>Deputy Chief, NSA/CSS Japan Representative Okinawa<br>Run Date: 06/19/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Palm trees waving in the warm winds. Outlying islands<br>breaking the horizon of the East China Sea. Red hibiscus and<br>purple bougainvillea in glorious bloom. Slender white cranes finding<br>breakfast wiggling in the newly mown grass of the golf course. U.S.<br>Air Force F-15 STRIKE EAGLE fighter aircraft roaring off the<br>runway, blazing trails far away in the Carolina blue skies, followed<br>shortly by the black-tipped nose of the RC-135 RIVET JOINT<br>heading north to the Sea of Japan. What's SIGINT doing in a place<br>like this?!? It's making a difference, every day. That's what!<br>Konnichi-wa and greetings from the tropics, the southernmost<br>prefecture of Japan -- Okinawa -- and an outpost of the Extended<br>Enterprise.<br>(C//SI) The customer set for SIGINT here on Okinawa numbers in<br>the tens of thousands and represents every branch of the U.S.<br>armed forces as well as the State Department and other elements<br>of the Intelligence Community. At over 26,000, the U.S. military<br>personnel on Okinawa represent the largest number of American<br>combat forces regularly stationed anywhere outside the United<br>States. All of those forces require specific intelligence support from<br>national systems to complement their own tactical intelligence<br>capabilities. Now, start counting family members, U.S. government<br>civilians of all skills, school teachers, and others supporting those<br>combat forces and the total goes up to over 51,000 personnel!<br>(C//SI) That number of foreigners is bound to have an effect,<br>sometimes adverse, on the local and national economy, traffic<br>control and law enforcement. Those effects are frequently<br>magnified and end up as issues for discussion among policy<br>makers in Tokyo and Washington, D.C. who require even more<br>specialized SIGINT support. And did you know that the front end<br>for the majority of signals collected for exploitation at the Kunia<br>RSOC in Hawaii is located here on Okinawa? Formerly known as<br>NSGA Hanza, the site, just a stone's throw away from beautiful<br>Torii Station beach, is now known as the Defense Communications<br>Detachment Okinawa and is run by a handful of government<br>contractors and a couple of Agency civilians.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.
