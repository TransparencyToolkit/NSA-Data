SAMESHEET is a group for discussing media over packet in the SIGINT community.
It initially dealt with just VOIP, but has expanded its scope. These notes get mailed
out after each monthly meeting (usually held the third Wednesday of every month.)
Look for reminders, calls for Agenda items, and notes on the voip@nsa alias. This
alias can be joined at: JJJ

This GCHQ record of SAMESHEET meetings is ended in favour of NSA's
version at: [21.

I encourage all those who have an interest to join NSA's alias directly.

[edit] IETF San Diego

(S//CCO)^^^^^H opened the meeting with a synopsis of the highlights from
this past months IETF meeting in San Diego. The IETF has been at the forefront of
Internet standards development over the last few decades ancMs responsible for the
SIP standard and future extensions. Of Sigint significance,^^Jpassed on a few
items such as the Globally Routable User-agent URI (GRUU) which is intended to
represent a specific piece of hardware of software instance for selection.
Implementations of the GRUU have been slowed due to privacy concerns.
Additionally, new session policy extensions may improve our ability to passively
target two sided communications by the incorporation of detailed call information
being included with XML imbedded in SIP messages. On the security front, SRTP
has been slow in the uptake do to key management limitations. At the meeting
however there was a significant amount of discussion surrounding Zimmerman's (of
PGP fame) ZRTP showing an easier to implement solution. SPEERMINT has been
very active as well discussing standards for multi and unilateral peering as well as
initial interest in standardization of the Session Border Controller services. Finally
peer-to-peer SIP is heating up which may lead to the formation of a new IETF

media encryption (p. 12-14), and information on pace of service provider adoption
of SIP for presence and instant messaging (p.15-16). Sprinkled throughout are
observations on how user identifiers may be changing (p.5,7,8). The executive
