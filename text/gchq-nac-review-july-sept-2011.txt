CNE Access to BELGACOM GRX Operator: (GREEN) Following the successful
NAC MyNOC OP SOCIALIST to provide CNE access to the BELGACOM GRX
Operator (MERION ZETA), the NAC have continued to provide assistance in
mapping out the internal network and providing direction to the CNE operator on the
best internal devices on which to have a presence. The end goal has been to enable
access to internal GRX routers that can then be used as platforms for MitM
operations against mobile handsets that are roaming.
