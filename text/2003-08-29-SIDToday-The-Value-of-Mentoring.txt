People have an innate desire to better themselves and to make<br>a difference to the people around them, both in their personal and professional lives. Within SID,<br>skill and career development are important for each of us, as well as for SID as an organization.<br>But how do we advance development? Formal mentoring programs are great, but there are<br>many things we do on a regular basis which also fall into that "thing" we call mentoring.<br>(U) How did you learn what you know about SIGINT?<br>(U//FOUO) Perhaps...<br>your supervisor enrolled you in some basic SIGINT courses;<br>a colleague sat sidesaddle with you and walked you through the functions of a particular<br>database;<br>a friend unraveled a complex acronym-oriented sentence for you;<br>a language analyst helped you understand the meaning of some foreign language jargon;<br>your team chief helped you write your first internal resume; or<br>a peer shared with you their worst and best first few days at NSA.<br>(U) How are you sharing what you know with others?<br>(U//FOUO) Do you...<br>show the new person in your office what databases and accounts they need to work<br>effectively?<br>provide budding linguists with in-house resources and guidance to help perfect their<br>language skills?<br>share a particular target trend you've noticed with a new Intelligence Analyst? or<br>recommend good external assignments to someone who is trying to plan their career 5<br>years down the road?<br>(U) This is mentoring?<br>(U) Sure it is - sharing knowledge and providing guidance and counsel to a lesser experienced<br>colleague. And it's a low cost investment and rewarding way to:<br>build essential skills and knowledge;<br>enhance leadership at all levels of the organization;<br>increase productivity and innovation;<br>provide greater agility in responding to opportunities by shortening the learning curve;<br>and<br>foster teamwork and break down barriers.<br>(U) Why is this important to you and to me?<br>(U//FOUO) Because tomorrow's success depends on you and me! And we need to...<br>welcome new employees into SID and show them the ropes. Let them know "the good,<br>the bad, and the ugly."<br>quickly bring colleagues up to speed. With today's fast-paced, continuous technological<br>advancements, and the complexity of targets and the global environment, we can't afford<br>the time it would take for every analyst to learn things on his/her own.<br><br> </p>capture today's knowledge base, develop the work force of tomorrow, and shape leaders<br>to ensure the future success of SIGINT!<br>(U//FOUO) To learn more about mentoring, I recommend you visit the Agency's Mentoring<br>Network website . In the future I will share articles with you on mentoring efforts currently<br>underway in the SIGINT Directorate, how to find a mentor in SID, and other related information.<br>In the interim, I encourage each of you to mentor others, seek out mentors, share your<br>knowledge, and learn from each other!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
