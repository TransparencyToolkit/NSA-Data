(U) There are many professions at work in SID: linguists,
mathematicians and cryptanalysts, to name a few. Did you know
that these groups are represented by professional societies here at
NSA? These "Learned Organizations" allow members of each
profession to share information, recognize outstanding
achievements in their field, and interact with peers.
(U) It's time for our annual round-up of Learned Orgs of interest to
those working in SID. We'll highlight several such associations in
the coming days. Watch for it!
