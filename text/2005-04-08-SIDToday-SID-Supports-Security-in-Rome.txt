(U) SID Supports Security in Rome
FROM: 
Chief, Office of Multinational and Second Party Affairs/DP16
Run Date: 04/08/2005

(U//FOUO) The death of Pope John Paul II has precipitated a series of high visibility public
events, which will draw VIPs and millions of pilgrims from around the world making Rome an
inviting terrorist target for the next few days.
(U//FOUO) Even if viewed only from the U.S. point of view, the next few days will be a security
nightmare as an unprecedented number of American VIPs will be in Vatican City for the funeral:
the current President and three former Presidents, all with their wives; the Secretary of State;
the President's National Security Advisor; and a large Congressional contingent.
(S//SI) NSA will be providing SIGINT threat warning support to - not only U.S. Embassy and
security officials in Rome - but also to our Italian SIGINT partners who are charged with
providing support to the Italian security services ultimately responsible for the safety of the
events. NSA is long experienced in providing this type of support to U.S. elements and our
partners. What is relatively new in our experience is engaging all of our SIGINT partners to
provide threat warning reporting to support multinational events. Similar to our experience
during the 2004 Olympics, NSA has again engaged all of its foreign partners to forward threat
warning reporting to NSA, which will then be shared with U.S. and Italian officials, as
appropriate. AS234 (Telecommunications and Network Support to Deployed Operations) has put
the finishing touches on software that will automatically pull partner reports related to this event
and send them to the TERR desk in NSOC (NSA's point of contact) for further dissemination.
(S//SI) Additionally, the Center for Executive Protection (the CEP, S2I044) has worked with
Counterterrorism's Operations Services branch to compile a comprehensive SIGINT support
matrix which serves as a platform for "one-stop shopping" for information on the organizations
involved in the Rome executive protection mission. The matrix includes information regarding
target focus, operational comments/posture, and staffing and contact information, and is
available upon request from CEP (DL cep1 or 
).
(U//FOUO) NSA - with the help of its foreign partners - is doing its best to ensure that the
somber events of the next few days and weeks will take place without incident.
