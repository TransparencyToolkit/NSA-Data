(S//SI) Spanish Partner Seeks NSA Assistance with Deployment to
Afghanistan
FROM: Michael Clifford
Country Desk Officer (CDO) Spain (DP12)
Run Date: 10/06/2005

Spaniards.
(S//SI) Although Spain's coalition efforts in Afghanistan have been ongoing for some time, the
NSA SIGINT relationship with Spain hasn't directly contributed to the effort. The scenario will
change dramatically this autumn when the Spanish intelligence service, the National Intelligence
Center (Centro Nacional de Inteligencia, CNI), deploys a SIGINT Unit to Herat, Afghanistan.
Spain currently has a Provincial Reconstruction Team in Herat and a Forward Support Base in
Qaleh-Ye Now. The planned deployment of a SIGINT Unit, however, will be a first for CNI and
has generated a laundry list of questions and requests for NSA support.

(S//SI) In response to CNI queries for assistance, the CDO and Country Team rapidly assembled
a cadre of NSA experts on the Afghanistan SIGINT environment, NSA capabilities, support to
military operations, personnel training requirements, and our own information needs. The goal is
the development of a qualified CNI SIGINT Unit that will successfully meet Spain's national force
protection and counterintelligence goals and satisfy NSA and coalition informational needs in the
theater.
(S//SI) In July, FAD [NSA/Foreign Affairs Directorate] hosted four CNI representatives from
Madrid to attend a two-day conference to discuss CNI's deployment schedule and offer lessons
learned from NSA experiences in Afghanistan. SID's Office of Regional Targets and the National
Tactical Information Office played important roles in characterizing the environment and helping
CNI prepare the SIGINT Unit to operate as an "expeditionary force." Additionally, the
International Crime and Narcotics (ICN) Product Line discussed the physical dangers of operating
in the narco-trafficking regions of Western Afghanistan. ICN also emphasized NSA's specific
information needs as we currently have no SIGINT coverage in the Herat region. FAD also
provided updates to the CNI visitors on coalition operations in Afghanistan and the scheduled
deployment of CENTER ICE, the tactical, secure multi-communications platform allowing realtime SIGINT information sharing and collaboration among coalition partners.
(S//SI) Now that the CNI delegation has returned to Spain, our task is to fulfill our commitments
to provide informational and technical solutions. FAD has initiated a request for release of
specific Digital Receiver Technology (DRT) capabilities to enable the SIGINT Unit to exploit the
communications they are expected to encounter. Pending approvals, the FAD Technical Services
Group will develop a scalable, shareable solution that will address CNI's needs and NSA
collection gaps. Finally, in response to approved recommendations, FAD will direct a timeline for
DRT programming, operator training, deployment, and installation that will culminate in CNI's
November SIGINT Unit deployment.
