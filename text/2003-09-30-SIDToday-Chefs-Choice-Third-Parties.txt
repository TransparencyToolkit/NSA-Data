This is the first in a series of monthly articles in which I'll be speaking to you<br>about what's happening in SID, from my perspective. I think this is a great opportunity for me to<br>let you know what we're up to and where I see things headed. To kick things off, today I'd like<br>to talk to you about an issue that has a major effect on our business: our Third Party<br>connections. How can we make full use of the capabilities and resources they can offer us as<br>SIGINT partners?<br>(S//SI) Our Third Party relationships are different from our Second Party ties in that we do not<br>share information across the board with the nations involved - rather, we draw up tailored<br>agreements to collaborate on particular missions and share only specified types of information<br>and capabilities. This does not mean, however, that we can't have very productive dealings with<br>them! In fact, I think we can go substantially further than we have so far in working with other<br>countries to get the best SIGINT we can to our customers. As someone once said, "If you always<br>do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got!" We need to look at things with<br>new eyes and be more aggressive in taking advantage of these partnerships where it makes<br>sense.<br>(S//SI) In some cases, Third Party associates can provide us with SIGINT collection or reporting<br>that we simply could not, or should not, duplicate. If a Third Party believes they are in a good<br>position to provide collection or a service that we are using our resources to cover, we shouldn't<br>dismiss it. We should take the opportunity to check it out. If it is true, then take them up on it!<br>Perhaps we could use our resources on something of a higher priority. Frankly, since 9/11, and<br>with the war in Iraq, we just haven't had the time to give this question the attention it deserves.<br>When Third Party officials meet with me, they know very well what's on their agenda. Believe<br>me, it wouldn't be a good thing if I had absolutely no clue what we wanted to accomplish! So<br>now, SID, IAD and FAD (Foreign Affairs Directorate) are working together (see SID today ) to<br>establish the Strategic Direction of these relationships in a coordinated way, and to try to be<br>creative with solutions.<br>(S//SI) For example? Well, if we can't deal with the civilian authorities in a certain country, can<br>we establish a military-to-military agreement? Can we deal with countries that aren't necessarily<br>our close allies when it's mutually advantageous to do so? Will prudent, but aggressive, sharing<br>of SIGINT-derived information with a foreign SIGINT partner advance U.S. policy goals? Let's<br>look into it!<br>(S//SI) As you go about your work, I ask you to give this matter some thought. If you have an<br>idea on how we can better use our Third Party ties in your area of expertise, run it up the<br>flagpole with your management. Talk to the right people in FAD, starting with the Foreign Affairs<br>Officers FAD has deployed in your organization. Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's not - but<br>don't give up until you've determined which it is. Don't assume it's impossible - let's seize those<br>opportunities!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p></p>
