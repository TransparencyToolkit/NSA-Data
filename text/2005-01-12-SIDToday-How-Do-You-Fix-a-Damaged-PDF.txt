(U) How Do  You Fix a Damaged PDF?

(U) Last month, SID today 's DNI columnist Raul posted an article on repairing damaged PDF
files . We heard from a few analysts via the feedback mechanism that is available at the end of
every article on SID today . What follows is a sampling of that feedback.
(U//FOUO) There is a program that tries to "repair" a PDF file. It was published as an
Informal Technical Note (ITN) S3T/TECH/11/2004 - S-249, 497 entitled "Repairing
Broken PDF Files."
(U)...Another resource for extracting data has been CSE. I have obtained Perl routines
that have enabled me to extract information from PDF files using the PDF structure.
(U//FOUO)...A comment is made in this article that NSA does not have a capability
against damaged PDF files. Actually, on the DESERTFOX (go DESERTFOX) team, we have
a program called KEYSTONE that contains a damaged-PDF converter...This software only
handles PDF files compressed using flate. Since flate is found in the vast majority of PDF
files that we see, this has been a good solution for us for the past year. Sadly, it does not
handle foreign character sets due to the tremendous amount of work required to pull out
the (potentially damaged) code pages. The damaged-PDF converter has been ported to
SORCERER and could even be provided as a stand-alone program. I sincerely hope that
some effort was made to locate a program such as KEYSTONE before making the
overarching statements, "No consideration has been given..." and "We should be able to
deal with broken or damaged PDFs with great ease."
(S) Why not just use pdftotext with UTF-8 encoding specified for output? This handles the
decompression and encoding normalization issues, from what I've seen...(NOTE:
pdftotext is one of the many valuable command-line utilities that comes with the xpdf
application.)
