The Precision<br>Fire System uses Global Positioning System (GPS) information with digital video to derive<br>precise targeting coordinates (geolocation) without the need for known ground control. The<br>immersive photographic technology has important applications and is a vital tool that can be<br>used to make force protection and site security decisions. The geospatial analysts will be<br>demonstrating applications of both technologies and will show the importance of using this type<br>of geospatial intelligence.<br>(U//FOUO) Due to limited seating capacity in the conference room, please contact<br>nsa), NSA Rep to NGA , <br> if you are interested in attending.
