Community Integration, Policy and Records

(U//FOUO) This document establishes information security guidelines on NSA/CSS-sponsored
research in the field of quantum computing (QC). The objectives defining the scope of this
research activity are:

1)	(S//REL) To assess if it is to NSA’s benefit to continue research into whether
practical-scale QC can be developed within a reasonable timeframe, to identify its most
promising physical embodiment(s), and to formulate a credible scenario for its large-scale
development;

2)	(U//FOUO) To gain an understanding of the computational cryptanalytic capabilities
of quantum computers; and

3)	(U//FOUO) To identify practical cryptographic methods that are not susceptible to
quantum computational attack.

(S//REL) These guidelines do not cover the possibility of large-scale cryptologic QC
development programs at NSA, but only the research and planning preliminary to, and in
possible support of, such programs.

(S//SI//REL) Much of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most
effectively pursued in NSA-funded open research programs. These programs play a critical role
as the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the field. However, NSA
is pursuing more than just basic, unclassified research. NSA is also attempting to preserve the
SIGINT potential of quantum computing (i.e., the cryptanalytic applications of QC) while
simultaneously attempting to protect the information security of both the Government and
private sectors against hostile QC attacks (i.e., the cryptographic, mission assurance applications
of QC of interest to the Information Assurance community). These goals must be pursued at the
classified level.

(U//FOUO) There are several fundamental reasons for classifying QC research:

1)	(TS//SI//REL) To protect NSA’s efforts to develop cryptanalytic QC to attack high-
grade public key encryption systems by denying adversaries information concerning
NSA’s assessment of, and/or plans for, large-scale QC development;

TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

TOP SECRET//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL

2)	(S//REL) To enable us to track our adversaries’ degree of success or failure in similar
QC development efforts; and

3)	(U//FOUO) To protect our own systems against adversarial cryptanalytic QC efforts.

(S//REL) Based on this, the distinctions between unclassified and classified information
contained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassified basic-level, academic-scale
research of scientific interest, and more comprehensive classified research which might disclose
techniques that may otherwise be possible to protect, or which might imply, rightly or wrongly,
serious intent on NSA’s part to pursue large-scale development of cryptanalytic quantum
computers.

(U) DEFINITIONS

(U) Cryptanalysis - The study of breaking codes and ciphers.

(S//SI//REL) Cryptanalytic-Scale - (as applied to quantum computers) Large enough to perform
computations of actual cryptanalytic importance to NSA. A more specific definition is likely to
be compartmented, and will change over time.

(U) Cryptography - The principles, means, and methods for rendering plain information
unintelligible to the uninitiated and for restoring encrypted information to intelligible form.

(U) Cryptology - The art and science of making codes/ciphers and breaking them,. Cryptology
breaks out into two disciplines: cryptography (making or using codes/ciphers) and cryptanalysis
(breaking codes/ciphers).

(U) Detailed engineering design - Specifications of a set of qubits and the associated
initialization, control, and measurement hardware and software at a level of detail commensurate
with the requirements of industrial fabrication.

(U) Fidelity - Precision of qubit operations such as initialization, logic gates, and readout.

(U) High-fidelity A-qubit Device - An engineered processing device that integrates N coupled,
high-fidelity physical qubits, i.e., qubits with fidelity of operations near or beyond the accuracy
threshold for efficient error correction.

(S//REL) Level A QC - Unclassified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design,
physical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory
for Physical Sciences/R3.

(S//REL) Level B QC - Classified theoretical and/or experimental research in the design,
physical implementation, and operation of quantum computers, as established by the Laboratory
for Physical Sciences/R3. The boundaries are based on the number and quality of qubits, realism
and specificity of design, control precision, and detail of analysis. While these boundaries may
change over time, as of the publication of this guide, the values are:

detection and correction both of errors and of loss of quantum coherence.

(U) For the purposes of this guide, the circuit configuration of a logical qubit must allow
detection and correction of at least all errors affecting any single physical qubit. A logical
qubit comprising N physical qubits must also be a high-fidelity N-qubit device.

exists to construct the device with a cost, probability of success, and time-scale of actual
cryptanalytic importance to NSA. A more specific definition is likely to change over time.

(U) Quantum coherence - The fundamental quantum-mechanical property of qubits and
collections of qubits which may enable some computations to be performed with resources vastly
smaller than would be required for classical computers.
