INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY (IC) REACH
TEAM (C// REL TO USA, FVEY)
(Submitted by the SID Technical Director)

(C//REL TO USA. FVEY) ICREACH is an NSA information-sharing initiative for
customers and analysts across the Intelligence Community overseen by the Director from
concept to implementation. This team began over two years ago with a basic concept
compelled by the IC’s increasing need for communications metadata and NSA’s ability to
collect, process and store vast amounts of communications metadata related to worldwide
intelligence targets. The ICREACH team delivered the first-ever wholesale sharing of
communications metadata within the U.S. Intelligence Community. The SID team did
considerable work with NSA/OGC (Office of the General Counsel) and SID Policy to
ensure appropriate legal and policy approvals for this new technical capability. In
addition, the team briefed the Second Party partners on this effort to set the stage for
Second Party participation in ICREACH. Their efforts hastened implementation of this
much-needed capability.
