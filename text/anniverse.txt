Special US Liaison Activity Germany has spent a year in a "tin can" (It's better
than it sounds - it's the nickname for their new facility!) (S//SI)

(S//SI) In April, the Special US Liaison Activity Germany (SUSLAG) celebrated one
year in their purpose-built facility on the German Ministry of Defense facility
Mangfall Kaseme in Bad Aibling, Germany, SUSLAG (formerly known as Combined
Group Germany) was compelled to find a new home by the closure of its previous
host, Bad Aibling Station,

Chief SUSLAG, helps^^^^^^(Chief of
Engineering and Maintenance/KE-60) plant a tree in front of the new SUS^G
buiidrn^oii Mangfall Kaseme, Alsc^oarticipatina are, from left to

Kaseme/LA-60).

(S//SI) Thanks to the combined efforts of the Bad Aibling Transition Team, the
Technical Support Program Management Office, Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND,
the German intelligence service and our German partner), the European Technical
Center (ETC), ITD, NCEUR, I&L1^, and others too numerous to mention, the
building was completed in just4lA months, from groundbreaking to move-in, all
during the depths of winter, (SUSLAG's BND colleagues affectionately refer to the
new SUSLAG building as “Die Blechdose" or “the Tin Can," owing to its difference
in appearance from the other buildings on Mangfall Kaseme - it has no windows, is
made of metal and is shelter-like in appearance), SUSLAG went off NSANET at Bad
Aibling Station on Friday, 3 April 2004, and reappeared on NSANET in the new
facility on the following Monday, thanks to an outstanding team of IT professionals
working through the weekend,

(S//SI) In addition to SUSLAG's long-standing role as liaison to the German
intelligence service, it is parent to two exciting joint ventures, the Joint
Analysis Center (JAC) and the Joint SIGINT Activity (JSA). The Joint Analysis

(S//SI) JSA, the JAC's younger sibling, was declared operational last year and
continues to build toward full operating capability, which is expected by the end of
2005, The JSA is the outcome of an agreement between the Director, NSA, and the
President of the BND to launch a strategic cooperation initiative in the mutual
pursuit of intelligence related to counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and other
transnational targets,

(S//SI) With the establishment of a US-only communications center in the new
SUSLAG facility, it became possible to provide secure connectivity for JSA, piggy-
backing on SUSLAG's connection to ETC, at which point the JSA comms pass
through ETC's Third-Party guard device subsystem onto NSANET This provided for
the first time an electronic connection from NSA to JSA for tasking to flow in one
direction, and SIGINT in the other, JSA is primarily a SIGDEV asset from NSA's
point of view, but is an essential component of BND's collection architecture, JSA is

2 of 4

unique as a jointly manned, jointly tasked DNI site.

(S//SI) Followinq DIRNSA's dictum that making our foreign partners more capable
also makes NSA more capable, NSA personnel assigned to JSA are teaching their
DND counterparts new tools and techniques in advanced signals and protocol
analysis and DNI exploitation. But this is far more than an academic exercise ■■
training is being conducted in the course of executing tasked mission, currently
one NSA and two BND tasks. BND senior leadership recently commended JSA for
their efforts, particularly the contribution that JSA's Afghan GSM** task has made
to one of BND's highest priority task, Force Protection in Afghanistan. FQRNSAT
/SCS Mission Management has assigned primary responsibility to JSA for 10 beams
on seven satellites, and JSA is continually surveying these beams and feeding the
resulting metadata to NSA systems.

(S//SI) SUSLAG continues in its traditional role as SIGINT liaison to the

Federal Republic of Germany This role has been greatly facilitated by SUS LAG'S
new location on Mangfall Kaseme, NSA personnel interact daily with BND
counterparts, coordinating policy, conducting technical exchanges, expanding the
range of cooperation in SIGINT, and deepening the partnership in many ways. The
availability of SUSLAG‘s secure VTC facility on Mangfall Kaserne allows for a close
and continuing exchange with our partner based on an unprecedented series of
VTCs, Additionally, visiting NSA technical experts have immediate access to BND
counterparts, providing for an unmatched exchange of expertise,

(S//SI) SUSLAG is now established on a solid foundation for years to come. In the
past year, DIRNSA, SID's Deputy Director, and the Principal Director of Foreign
Affairs have visited to add emphasis to their charge to Chief, SUSLAG to broaden
and deepen the SIGINT relationship with the German partner, moving in new and
exciting directions. These efforts have already begun to bear fruit, and the future of
this productive partnership seems assured.
