(U) Change in CRD Leadership
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 06/20/2005

(U//FOUO) I want to take this opportunity to wish 
 well in her new assignment as
D/SUSLOL and to congratulate Charles Berlin on his new assignment as Deputy Director of
Customer Relationships (DDCR), which was effective COB 10 June 2005.
(U//FOUO) The Customer Relationships Directorate is truly the cornerstone of SIGINT. Unless we
are resigned to the production of SIGINT for the sake of SIGINT, we must have a complete
understanding of what the nation needs from SIGINT. We rely on the CRD to help customers
both understand how SIGINT can help them and help us understand their true needs. We can
then focus the system appropriately to execute the mission.
(U) We are grateful to 
 for her leadership of the CRD for the past two years. Under her
leadership, CRD has made transformational strides in the way NSA manages its customer
relationships. She and Charles have set a course for CR that provides a foundation for the future.
As the A/DDCR, Charles has been instrumental in our customer engagement strategy and will
make a smooth transition into the DDCR role.
(U) Please join me in congratulating both

 and Charles on their new endeavors.
