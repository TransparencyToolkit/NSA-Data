That<br>is why our dealings with Congress are so important. In this series,<br>we'll look at how SID interacts with Congress-- we think you'll be<br>surprised at how much work goes into this effort, most of it<br>invisible to the general SID workforce. The focal point within SID<br>for these interactions is SID Legislative Affairs (SID LA).<br>(U//FOUO) Our main contacts in Congress are with the following<br>four committees:<br>House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)<br>Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)<br>House Appropriations Committee (HAC)<br>Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC)<br>For budgeting purposes, the first two committees are known as<br>"authorizors", while the latter two are the "appropriators". Let's<br>look briefly at the budget process (we'll try to keep it simple!)...<br>(U) The Budget<br>(U) "Marking Up" the President's Budget<br>(U//FOUO) Since Congress controls the governmental purse<br>strings, many of our dealings with Congress are related to budget<br>issues. The process works like this:<br>The President submits a budget to Congress (with SID's<br>portion detailed in a document called the Congressional<br>Budget Justification Book - CBJB) requesting specified<br>amounts of money for NSA and 12 other agencies that are<br>part of the National Foreign Intelligence Program. Every<br>year, NSA's DF2 (Accounting and Financial Services) puts<br>together the CBJB based on input from SID and the rest of<br>the Agency, excluding IAD.<br>The above four congressional committees then review the<br>CBJB and "mark it up"- i.e. they indicate whether they think<br>the funding should be raised, lowered, or left the same. The<br>committee staffers also may request briefings on various<br>projects, to help them gauge the appropriate level of<br>funding.<br>The congressional committees then reconcile (this is<br>referred to as "conference") the various versions of their<br>mark ups, which result in the Intelligence Authorization Bill<br>and the Intelligence Appropriation Bill. At that point, it is<br>submitted to the full Congress for a vote and (if passed)<br>sent to the President for signature or veto.<br>(U) More on the CBJB<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID and Congress<br>1.
