At its essence, SIGINT is<br>intended to provide our military commanders and policymakers<br>with advance knowledge of foreign intentions and capabilities. If we<br>can deny our adversaries the element of surprise, we may be able<br>to outmaneuver them and achieve our goals peacefully... and we<br>can also prevent "Pearl Harbor" attacks from occurring.<br>(U//FOUO) For SIGINT to be effective in this anticipatory role, we<br>must not settle for simply describing and explaining facts - we<br>must interpret the facts and make estimates of likely future events.<br>To do this, SIGINT analysts must thoroughly understand both the<br>world of the policymaker/warfighter and the world of our targets.<br>Not only must we anticipate our customers' needs, we must<br>anticipate how our adversaries will behave, and where we will find<br>reflections of that behavior in foreign signals. We call this attempt<br>to get ahead of the game "active analysis".<br>(U) Two Approaches to Active Analysis<br>(U//FOUO) So how should we go about understanding the target?<br>An active approach to analysis can be based on two separate, but<br>interwoven, lines of attack: hypothesis-driven and discovery-driven<br>analysis.<br>In hypothesis-driven analysis , analysts begin with a<br>conceptual model of the target's intentions, capabilities and<br>behavior, and use that model or understanding to make<br>sense of new intercept, and to determine what tasking<br>should be.<br>In discovery-driven analysis , analysts begin with the data<br>(perhaps as a result of search and survey), and use<br>anomalies, patterns, or relationships within the data to<br>create a model or understanding of the target.<br>While somewhat oversimplified here, active SIGINT analysis<br>depends on the constant iteration of both hypothesis and<br>discovery, while keeping in mind the SIGINT customers'<br>dynamically evolving needs.<br>(U) Sharing Best Practices<br>(U//FOUO) For active analysis to succeed in preventing surprise,<br>we must recognize current best practices in analysis and spread<br>them throughout the analytic community. Since there is no<br>textbook to guide us as we meet emerging challenges, it is<br>essential that analysts carefully document the logic framing their<br>work, document new information discovered from databases, and<br>challenge each other to share their "best practices".
