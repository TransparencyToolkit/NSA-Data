(U//FOUO) Hard as it may be for us to believe, today is the second anniversary of the SID today
webpage. We'll use this occasion to remind (or inform) our readers of a few things:
1.  Anyone can submit an article. Don't wait for us or your management to invite you to
submit an article -- if you have a story to tell that would be of interest to the SID work
force, take the initiative and let us know your idea. On the right-hand side of the SID
today page you will find the "Submit an Item" box.
2.  If you have some information or observations to add to an article, send a Letter to the
Editor . We often post these letters as follow-up articles for everyone's benefit.
3.  Send us feedback at any time. We want to know what you think of the articles
presented and the page in general. Send us your ideas for future content.
4.  On a related note, it's time to award the second annual SIDney Award for the most
admired article. We'll review the positive feedback we received to all of the articles
(March 31, 2004 - March 31, 2005), tally them up, and proclaim a winner. It's not too
late to send in feedback -- if there was an article that you thought was particularly good,
but you never sent in feedback on it, do so now! You can call up the article in our SID
today archives and use the feedback option at the bottom of the text. We'll award the
prestigious SIDney Award to the winning author in the coming weeks.
(U) Thanks for reading and contributing to SID today !
