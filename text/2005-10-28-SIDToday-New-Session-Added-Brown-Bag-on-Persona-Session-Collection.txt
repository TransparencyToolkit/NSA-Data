(C//SI) Due to popular demand, SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is
pleased to announce a third session of CRSK 1500, a brown bag session on Persona Collection.
The discovery and collection of high-value target communications require the deployment of a
strategy through which strong selectors are applied against metadata-rich technologies and
accesses and which are used to tip off other technologies and accesses. Metadata analysis will
yield target discovery and new more powerful strong selectors. The distributed collection
approach includes identifying a particular target's communications, tipping between accesses,
associating many aggregate session parts, and presenting all of a target's communications to
the analyst via a single workstation and viewer.
(C//SI) The session will begin with an overview and status of PSC, followed by a focus on PSC
challenges. The overview will outline how PSC integrates with other SSG initiatives such as the:
implementation of SID's Metadata Strategy (CONDENSER),
the Master Association Manager (MAM),
the Unified Targeting Tool (UTT), and
GLOBALVISION.
Additionally, relationships to external programs such as:
CT production,
the Persona POD (#38),
TURBULANCE,
TRAFFICTHIEF,
WEALTHYCLUSTER 2.0,
X-KEYSCORE,
UIS, and
content repositories
...will also be addressed.
