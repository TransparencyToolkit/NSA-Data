Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 10/06/2003<br><br>(U) You've heard me talk about the importance of our capabilities-based SIGINT system.<br>Organized by function across the SID directorate, it has proven to be exceedingly agile and well<br>suited to our new, more global missions. But, like any organizational structure it comes at a<br>cost. Our ability to focus on our key threats, current and future, cuts across all of our<br>organizational boundaries.<br>(U) This challenges each of us to know and understand every last one of our missions and<br>priorities with sufficient detail such that we can make the best decisions about how we should<br>apply our capabilities. Even on our best days, this is exceptionally difficult to do. To help sort<br>through the competing needs, we've added Issue Manager Teams (IMT). Each IMT owns a<br>mission area and has the responsibility of helping us all understand SIGINT's role in that area.<br>An IMT is aware of where our strengths are and what we need to focus on in a mission area. The<br>outcome of this effort has been very rewarding.<br>(U) It is the tremendous success of our IMT concept that has led me to establish the position of<br>SIGINT Technical Leader (TL). The SIGINT TL will identify and champion the overarching mission<br>outcomes that will drive our continuing transformation of SIGINT. To accomplish this the SIGINT<br>TL will work with the other members of the SID Leadership Team including the DDs and staff,<br>the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), senior technical leaders, and others, both inside and outside<br>SID and NSA, to help translate mission opportunities and outcomes into new ways to make and<br>use SIGINT. I am pleased to announce that Dave Hurry has joined my staff as the first<br>SIGINT Technical Leader .<br>(U) Functionally, the SIGINT TL and the SID CTO will form a small team working for me to find<br>and improve the key drivers that make SIGINT better. Notionally, the SIGINT TL will look<br>externally and internally for new opportunities and challenges for SIGINT, and the CTO will find<br>the technologies and new technical approaches to solve them. While this type of innovation has<br>already been going on across SID and our partner organizations, the SIGINT TL and CTO will be<br>able to bring an added focus and focal point to these efforts.<br>(U) Needless to say, this technical team will be looking to you for ideas and areas to emphasize.<br>SIGINT has a virtually unlimited number of opportunities and challenges before it. Knowing<br>which ones to pursue and when to pursue them will be key in making rapid progress towards<br>our goals. The SIGINT Technical Leader will be a key player in the process to make this happen.<br>Please join me in welcoming and supporting Dave in this new position.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
