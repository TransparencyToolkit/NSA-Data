The SINIO Council Memorandum, "The World After Saddam: What is<br>Likely to Change," released in mid-July, was the response to Gen. Quirk's tasking. Taking the<br>basic assumption that the United States, its partners, and their adversaries are operating in a<br>modern global environment, and that activities or organizations in one region may have roots<br>that reach far beyond that region, the document examines this CRABGRASS analogy, introduced<br>at the first SID Town Meeting, hoping to trace the most significant roots and determine how they<br>have been impacted.<br>(U) How Has the War in Iraq Impacted the Most Critical Issue Sets?<br>(S) The SINIOs examined the most critical intelligence issues facing the community and grouped<br>them into three categories:<br>Global Threats is the first category - including those two issues that represent the<br>greatest threat to national security and continue to dominate the DCI's Priority List and<br>the new National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) - Terrorism and Weapons of<br>Mass Destruction (WMD).<br>The second category is World Order and includes five issues - "Axis of Evil," Regional<br>Stability in the Middle East, "Coalition of the Unwilling," Role and Significance of<br>Multilateral Organizations, and Global Economy - that continue to shift and change with<br>profound impact on traditional alliances and the balance of power.<br>The third category, Changing Battlefield includes Military Thinking, Information<br>Operations (IO), and Denial and Deception (D&amp;D;). This category has been the most<br>profoundly impacted by the war with Iraq and will cause nations around the world, both<br>friend and foe, to reconsider national defense strategies.<br>(U//FOUO) Critical Issues in a Post-Saddam World - Implications for SIGINT<br>(S//SI) The issues listed above are major concerns for U.S. policymakers and warfighters and<br>will remain of critical importance through the next year and a half, and longer. For each issue,<br>the SINIO Council has provided an assessment of the consequences for SIGINT in terms of our<br>need to surge, revise, or maintain our efforts against the major targets that comprise that issue<br>for the use of NSA senior leadership in determining the best alignment of SIGINT resources<br>against these challenges. Follow on activities with the Product Line Managers and within the<br>Data Acquisition organization are already being planned.<br>(U) Read More:<br>(U//FOUO) To access a briefing on "The World After Saddam: What is Likely to Change", click<br>HERE .<br>(U//FOUO) The SINIOs reside in the Strategic Intelligence Issues office within SID's Customer<br>Relationships Directorate.
