Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 12/11/2003<br><br>(U) Providing constructive criticism to our<br>employees is a tough job for leaders at all levels.<br>The fact is, one of the biggest problems is selfinflicted. I have heard an occasional leader whine about how it is<br>hard to criticize someone when they did not know what they were<br>supposed to do. Well, duh, whose fault is that? I am constantly<br>amazed by the last-minute nature of our evaluations and the lack<br>of effort early in the process.<br>(U) The main thing to do is start early and modify as needed. You<br>know, the old living document idea. First of all, have that<br>counseling conversation with your subordinates when the plan is<br>created, not when the evaluation is due. Think about the kind of<br>things the person would need to do to be thought of for promotion<br>at this point and cook up some stretch goals to help that process.<br>Most motivated employees want to know what they have to do to<br>get to the next level, and this is the way to get that out in the<br>open.<br>(U) While this is primarily a leader responsibility, the employee has<br>a part, too. Drafting the P3 plan is a chance to influence the action.<br>It is not impossible for you to propose some stretch goals for<br>yourself - especially in professional development. Don't you know<br>where you need work? Additionally, drafting your P3 plan is an<br>exercise in strategic thought and visioning. You will need this skill<br>as you rise up in the organization. Practice it now by envisioning<br>the next year and understanding the organizations goals and<br>picturing where you can make the best contribution. Leaving room<br>for change is also a good idea.<br>(U) The second problem with these plans is that they were not kept<br>up to date with regard to the changes we see every day. This is<br>easily fixable, too. As the commercial says, "Just do it!" As we head<br>into the promotion/compensation decision cycle next month, most<br>of the attention will be focused on the 2003 P3 evaluation and not<br>the P3 plan for 2004, but don't let it get behind.<br>(U) Meanwhile, I have heard some more whining about the onerous<br>administrative burden of the P3 evaluations. Not too much<br>sympathy here. As you know, we are trying hard to automate this<br>to make it easier to write up, but there is no program to generate<br>content. This is still the leader's responsibility. Yes, I know, many<br>of you are asked to draft your evaluation, too. Again, think of this<br>as a marvelous opportunity to influence the outcome (as long as<br>you realize it is just a "suggestion" for the boss to consider).<br>Mostly, the onerous nature of the whole thing is due to the lastminute nature of your process.<br>(U) Remember, it's the "One-Minute Manager" not the "LastMinute Manager".<br><br> SERIES: <br>The Bald Truth<br>1.
