(U//FOUO) Seminar: Threats to Computer Systems
FROM: 
SINIO for Information Operations (S17)
Run Date: 09/09/2005

(U) Trojans, viruses, and worms! Oh, my! Yes, Dorothy, the cyber world is a dangerous place,
and now you can add identity theft on a massive scale to your list of computer phobias.
(U) The Internet is an excellent medium for the exchange of information and legitimate users
generate the vast majority of Internet traffic. Unfortunately, an invisible subculture exists to
take advantage of computer networks for nefarious purposes including vandalism, crime, or
espionage.
(U//FOUO) This seminar will discuss the current and evolving threats to computer systems
including remote means, insiders, and the supply chain. Traditional and non-traditional cyber
foes will be presented along with their cyber targets of interest and known exploitation
techniques. A novel concept will be presented that urges a shift in focus from "cyber security" to
"information security." After this session, you won't look at your PC, cell phone, PDA, or
computer laptop in the same way ever again.
(C) After a productive and successful career in private industry, Dr. Brian Shaw served as a
senior analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency and was appointed as Deputy National
Intelligence Officer for Science and Technology to the National Intelligence Council in 1999. His
primary responsibility was for preparation and coordination of National Estimates on cyber
operations and warfare, information technologies, and science and technology trends. He joined
the Analysis Group of the CIA Information Operations Center as Senior Advisor in 2004.
(U) The presentation will be held on 19 September 2005, from 0930-1230 in Ops1 2E099.
(U) The classification level of this presentation is TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN and is open to
all NSA badgeholders. No need to register -- just show up!
