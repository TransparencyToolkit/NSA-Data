The purpose of our visit was<br>to gain a better understanding of the USSTRATCOM mission and to begin building a relationship<br>with this customer by exchanging information on their mission, their expectations for SIGINT<br>support , and NSA's capabilities to respond to their requirements for products and services. We<br>discussed these issues over the course of two days with Lt Gen Thomas Goslin, D/Commander<br>USSTRATCOM; RADM James McArthur, Director Global Operations; Brig Gen Kim McKenzie,<br>Director JFHQ-IO, RADL (s) Frank Drennan, Director Strike Plans, and several members of their<br>staffs.<br>(U//FOUO) It is not entirely true to say that USSTRATCOM - located on the former Strategic Air<br>Command (SAC) base in Omaha, Nebraska - is a new customer, since it assumed the missions<br>of some former commands. Changes to the Unified Command Plan, approved by SECDEF and<br>the President, disestablished USSPACECOM and created USNORTHCOM and USSTRATCOM on 1<br>October 2002. (See a related article for further background information.) In fact, one of the<br>most fascinating aspects of the visit was learning about the complex and multifaceted mission<br>that has been assigned to USSTRATCOM, a mission that demonstrates the virtual global nature<br>of today's targets enabled by a highly networked world.<br>(U//FOUO) USSTRATCOM's primary responsibility to provide national preemptive options to the<br>President and SECDEF will require an unprecedented level of global situational awareness. To<br>carry out its planning and coordination roles, USSTRATCOM will in effect be a virtual component<br>on the planning team of all other commands. During our visit, MG Quirk noted that<br>USSTRATCOM "has a unique assortment of missions with unique alertment requirements."<br>USSTRATCOM will continue to evolve its overarching, integrated operational concept and, on 4<br>January, report to the President and SECDEF on its status and readiness to fully assume these<br>missions.<br>(U//FOUO) Over the next few months, SID organizations will be working with USSTRATCOM<br>through the NCR <br> to improve lines of communication, examine the skill and<br>manning needs of the Cryptologic Service Group (CSG) serving USSTRATCOM, perform an<br>intelligence needs assessment with the Command, and develop mutually beneficial information<br>sharing and collaborative analytic activities. A USSTRATCOM survey team will visit NSA in the<br>upcoming weeks to look at analytic tools and also determine where it would be mutually<br>beneficial to integrate USSTRATCOM analysts into SID.<br>(U//FOUO) This highly successful visit resulted in both a better understanding of requirements<br>and capabilities on the part of both USSTRATCOM and SID and set in motion a range of actions<br>that will strengthen our partnership in achieving the desired SIGINT outcomes for this command<br>and our nation.
