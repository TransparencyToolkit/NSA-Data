Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 08/03/2005
(U//FOUO) On Tuesday, 9 August 2005 the SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School
are pleased to present the 9th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for the
Summer 2005. " Emerging Technology: Millimeter Wave (MMW) Weapon Systems " will be
presented by the SINIO and D/SINIO for Science and Technology, Dr. Richard Longbothum, and
 on Tuesday, 9 August from 11:30 to 13:00 in room 2E099. Advance
registration through the NCS is required. (AREA-1500, Class #7538)
Registration:
(U//FOUO) Eligible SID students interested in attending this brown-bag session should enroll for
class number 7538 using Peoplesoft. Enrollment will be first come, first served. In case of
difficulties with Peoplesoft an email can be sent to Roland Recker
nsa) with the
following information, and include the course name (AREA 1500 -- "Emerging Technology:
Millimeter Wave (MMW) Weapon Systems"), your name, SSN and organization.
Course Overview:
(S) Some of the newest military technologies to appear on the future battlefield are radardirected weapon systems that operate at frequencies in excess of 30 gigahertz. These systems
which represent one of the first applications of nanotechnology on the battlefield, require
knowledge of atomic and molecular physics to fully understand their operational and system
limitations. The Intelligence Community has extremely limited capability to intercept and collect
signals from these weapon systems. Therefore, the DCI Scientific and Technical Intelligence
Committee (STIC) tasked its Advanced Collection System Working Group (ACSWG) to do an
assessment of this collection shortfall and report back to the IC. The assessment was performed
by the ACSWG and reported back to the committee in STIC 2003-003, dated December 2003.
Results of this assessment are presented in the talk, and will include the latest MMW targets.

series.
