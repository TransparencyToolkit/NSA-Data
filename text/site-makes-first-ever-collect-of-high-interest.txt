RAINFALL (F78)

Run Date: 02/23/2010

(TS//SI//REL) A collaborative effort between on-site collectors, engineers, and off-site
contractors in mid-January 2010 allowed RAINFALL to make what is believed to be the first
collection, by any known asset, of Time Division-Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) 4G
(fourth generation) cellular communications. Exploitation of this signal, an all-Internet
Protocol successor to 2G and 3G cellular systems, is a very high priority for NSA and the
Intelligence Community. The TD-LTE signal will enter the market in 2010 and become
globally important by 2012.
