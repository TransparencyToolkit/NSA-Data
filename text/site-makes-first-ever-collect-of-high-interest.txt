RAINFALL (F78)

A collaborative effort between on?site collectors, engineers, and off?site
contractors in mid?January 2010 allowed RAINFALL to make what is believed to be the first
collection, by any known asset, of Time Division?Long Term Evolution 4G
(fourth generation) cellular communications. Exploitation of this signal, an all?Internet
Protocol successor to 2G and 3G cellular systems, is a very high priority for NSA and the
Intelligence Community. The signal will enter the market in 2010 and become
globally important by 2012.
