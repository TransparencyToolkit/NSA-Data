Today I'd like to<br>relate details you may not know of the role played by SID analysts and others<br>to help make that operation a success.<br>(S//SI) On March 25th, two days after Private Lynch was captured, the DCI Underground Facility<br>Analysis Center (UFAC) asked NSA for all available SIGINT that would characterize the An<br>Nasiriya Saddam General Hospital: they had seen indications that high-level Iraqis were using<br>the underground portion of the hospital for command and control and as a "sanctuary." In<br>response, SIGINT Support to Information Operation's (SSIO) Underground Facility (UGF)<br>Support Cell (see description at the end of this article) quickly pulled SIGINT reporting dating<br>back to November 1979; our reports showed that the An Nasiriya facility had been built by the<br>Japanese firm "Marubeni Corporation."<br>(TS//SI) Later, on March 27th, SID's Middle East-North Africa (MENA) Product Line reported that<br>"a wounded U.S. female soldier was at the Saddam hospital." This prompted the Joint Special<br>Operations Command (JSOC) to request additional information on the facility in preparation for a<br>planned rescue operation. A formal request incorporating SIGINT went to the Defense Human<br>Intelligence Service (DHS) seeking assistance in securing blueprint information from the<br>Japanese firm. Once obtained, UFAC analyzed the An Nasiriya facility blueprints and sent them<br>as digital files to JSOC elements "literally minutes before the aircraft departed with the strike<br>team" on April 1st. During the rescue operation, the GEOCELL Watch maintained a near realtime watch box for any hostile personal communications system activity in the area around the<br>hospital.<br>(S//SI) Effective collaboration involving elements from SSIO, MENA, GEOCELL Watch, DHS, the<br>Special Operations Forces NIST (National Intelligence Support Team), and UFAC helped provide<br>JSOC forces with intelligence critical to the success of this mission. Well done to all concerned!<br>(S) The NSA UGF Support Cell was established in SSIO on 26 August 2002 as part of the DCI's<br>request to create an interagency effort capable of providing complete, up-to-the-minute allsource data to battlefield commands regarding foreign underground facilities and their<br>operations. This interagency effort assesses the infrastructure and vulnerabilities of underground<br>facilities used by hostile governments or military forces. Such information assists the warfighter<br>in planning operations to destroy or disable an underground facility or, in this case, to rescue<br>U.S. personnel and save lives.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
