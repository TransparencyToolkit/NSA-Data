(U) One Writer's 'Slant' on Punctuation (repost)
FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 08/19/2005

(U) The following essay was submitted anonymously:
(U) The growing/increasing use/application of the slash/backslant in written/printed and
spoken/oral communication/missives has become something of an epidemic/scourge.
(U) This practice/habit may have begun/started as a sort/type of shorthand/abbreviation for
briefings/presentations where space/room on a briefing/presentation chart/viewgraph is
limited/tight. Nevertheless it has become a standard/regular habit/custom among many
authors/writers today. This is unfortunate/malefic.
(U) It does not improve/sustain understanding/discernment. It disrupts/interferes with
smooth/even reading. The backslant/slash is not an acceptable/satisfactory punctuation
mark/conjunction. In most cases/applications it should be replaced/substituted with a comma or
the simple/modest conjunction "and". In some cases/usages the conjunction "or" would be
preferred/proper. In many cases/usages one of the two words/phrases separated/delimited by
the backslant/slash should simply/clearly be dropped/eliminated. The only/single
proper/acceptable use/application of the backslant/slash is in the properly/appropriately
applied/used phrase "and/or" meaning "either one or the other or both".
(U) Please do not use/apply the backslant/slash in written/printed materials. Although the
phrasing verb/verb or noun/noun has become somewhat popular, it is incorrect/wrong. It
implies the author is uncertain, confused, or cannot decide upon the appropriate term. It does
nothing to improve a well written text and cannot save one that is poorly constructed.
(U) Editor's note: We rummaged through the SID today archives for this one. It was originally
published on January 30, 2004.
