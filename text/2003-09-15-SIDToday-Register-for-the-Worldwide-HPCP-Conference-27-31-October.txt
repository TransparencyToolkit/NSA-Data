This will be the first HPCP<br>conference; it was decided that due to the disparate HPCP collection efforts necessitated by OIF<br>(Operation IRAQI FREEDOM) the Intelligence Community needed to orchestrate a cohesive plan<br>of attack, as well as inform the Intelligence Community of all HPCP efforts across the board.<br>(U) INTENT<br>(S//SI) HPCP communications are increasing exponentially worldwide. This technology is<br>becoming a dominant form of communications in many areas of interest for both tactical and<br>strategic customers, providing a unique way of finding and exploiting targets that cannot be<br>replicated through other SIGINT accesses. The need to understand this technology has been<br>compounded by the need to provide force protection in Iraq. Emphasis on metadata analysis and<br>target development is paramount in prosecuting the targets using this technology.<br>(S//SI) The HAC, founded by SSG in May 2003 to provide the community a focal point for HPCP<br>issues, is hosting this conference to coordinate the HPCP effort, eliminate duplication of effort,<br>and facilitate the sharing of information and technology throughout the Intelligence Community.<br>Although attendance is filling up fast, conference registration is still available at the Conference<br>Website (or type "go hpcp").<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
