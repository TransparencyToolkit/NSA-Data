This means, for example, that paragraphs formerly portion<br>marked TSC (TOP SECRET UMBRA) will become TS//SI (TOP SECRET//COMINT), and SC<br>(SECRET SPOKE) will become S//SI (SECRET//COMINT).<br>(U//FOUO) By way of background, the "new" IC markings were instituted by the National SIGINT<br>Committee in October 1999. However, use of the new markings required extensive changes to<br>the HIGHTIDE software used to issue reports. On 25 April of this year, most of the software<br>modifications were completed to allow the new markings to appear in the "manually-generated"<br>parts of a report, i.e. the text. The machine-generated overall classification line will continue to<br>show the "old" markings until the system is fully modernized, however. SID's Reporting Policy<br>and Guidance office has issued a memo authorizing and explaining the use of the new markings-click here for further details.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
