1 of 4

(S//SI) Good as it is, the ESC is about to get better. On 5 July 2006, the
Director, NSA approved the "ESOC Concept" which transforms the European
Security Center (ESC) into the European Security Operations Center (ESOC),
With this move, NSA will help build up the Center's capabilities to allow it to
assume even greater responsibilities within the worldwide SIGINT Enterprise,
What will change, specifically?

(U) More Missions

(S//SI) Beginning in FY07 through FYI3, the ESOC will evolve by expanding or
adding more missions that will support national, theater and regional intelligence
needs, ESOCs new or expanded missions include:

*	additional select Counterterrorism targets,

*	the African Union,

*	Nigerian Energy Security,

*	targets in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, and

*	complementary capabilities in SIGINT Development, Geospatial Analysis and
Technical SIGINT

(U) Changes in Manning

(S//SI) ...But that's not the only change. To ensure manning stability and to foster
true national/tactical integration, a core of NSA civilians and multi-service Service
Cryptologic Element military personnel* will work side-by-side with the (primarily)
Army tactical SIGINT personnel who have manned the ESOC since its start-up.

(U) Background: The ESC

(TS//SI) The European Security Center, primarily a theater SIGINT Center manned
by Army Tactical SIGINT personnel from the 105th Military Intelligence Battalion
in Darmstadt, Germany, was created over two years ago. It was the first center to
use tactical resources - augmented by a few NSA civilians -- to work both theater
information needs as well as national missions.

(TS//SI) Today, the ESC is highly successful in producing intelligence for both
national customers and the European Command, Its national mission focuses on
select Counterterrorism targets, select Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa target
sets, SIGINT Development and Geospatial Analysis missions. Its theater missions
include Force Protection, Global War on Terrorism support, Pan Sahel**, and
targets in West Africa.

(TS//SI) The ESCs most recent SIGINT accomplishments include providing the
majority of reporting and target tracking on the April 2006 coup attempt in Chad;
providing linguistic and analytic support during the on-going Israeli-Lebanon crisis
and providing analytic and linguistic support which facilitated the arrests of
terrorist facilitators operating in Italy,

(S//SI) The "ESOC Concept

(S//SI) The decision to move forward with the creation of the ESOC was founded on
the site's ability to,..

*	contribute to the national mission,

*	plug into Theater all-source elements,

*	optimize support to Theater operations,

*	provide tactical over-watch (intelligence support to deployed troops), and

*	maximize Second and Third party partnerships.

Under DIRNSA guidance, the US Army will retain its role as Executive Agent and
Cryptologic Host for the new ESOC.

(S//SI) When fully realized, the "ESOC Concept'" will be a model for future
national/tactical integration, by providing an in-theater capability to produce
high-impact analysis in support of all levels of national, tactical and Theater
information needs.
