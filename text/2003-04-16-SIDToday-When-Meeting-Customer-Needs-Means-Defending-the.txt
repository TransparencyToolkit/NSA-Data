We hope that this series engenders questions,<br>suggestions and interactions that will infuse SID's continued<br>transformation.<br>(S//SI) The core of our customer relationships is understanding<br>and meeting our customers' Information Needs. Those needs, as<br>you all know, are myriad. Working in the SID is a challenge since<br>meeting customer needs means defending the nation, supporting<br>the campaign against terrorism, and providing vital support to<br>warfighters under fire in Iraq and to the National Policy Makers who<br>must now engage in Iraq's reconstruction. Meeting customer needs<br>also means both maintaining coverage on other national SIGINT<br>priorities, such as the continuing crisis in North Korea, and<br>enduring strategic issues, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br>That challenge is being met successfully today through hard work,<br>innovation, partnership, and Information Needs (IN) management,<br>all of which combine to produce cohesive, positive outcomes. That<br>coordinated effort will be demonstrated in our five-part series.<br>(S//SI) The war in Iraq has presented a prism through which we<br>have been able to view the effectiveness of our planning,<br>programs, and relationships. Central to our strategy are our efforts<br>to make customers more active participants in the SIGINT system<br>by giving them the ability to see into and influence USCS activities.<br>The next article in this series (i.e. the second) on the National<br>SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) will describe the orderly flow<br>of Information Needs during the war. In terms of success, you may<br>compare the present manageable flow of Information Needs to that<br>of the days, weeks, and months following 11 September 2001<br>when INs under the former RFI system increased by over 1,000<br>percent, threatening to overwhelm intelligence production.<br>(S//SI) CRD's strategic thinking and customer interaction are<br>aimed at a deeper understanding of customer needs. They are also<br>coupled with creativity and innovation to engender the interaction<br>of decision makers, warfighters and IC partners with SIGINT in new<br>ways--and sometimes with new customers. The third article will<br>showcase both new customers, like U.S. Northern Command<br>(NORTHCOM) and the Missile Defense Agency, as well as new ways<br>of interacting with major customers to deliver SIGINT into the<br>customers' information space that is secure, usable, accessible and<br>timely.<br>(S//SI) In the fourth article, you will have the opportunity to read<br>a Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) perspective from U.S.<br>United Nations (USUN) SEAM <br>and her SEAM Team<br>who are the models of customer relationship management. The<br>SEAM Team has transformed that relationship from a transactional<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Customer Relations<br>1.  When Meeting<br>Customer Needs<br>Means Defending the<br>Nation<br>2.
