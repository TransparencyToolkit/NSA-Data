(U//FOUO) A recent article cited an NSA memo that asked employees to "Please stop utilizing

(U//FOUO) Your article on the "use versus utilize" memo should also reference an earlier memo
by then-DIRNSA Adm. Noel Gayler . It was two sentences, (if I can remember correctly) and
said: "In the future, all memos will be short and to the point. This is an example." This was
followed in a week by a 5-page staff memo "explaining" what DIRNSA meant.
