For each award, a category was added to recognize mid-career<br>accomplishments. In this first of two articles, we'll focus on the recipients of the Jaffe Award.<br>(S//REL) The winner of the Sydney Jaffe Award, Mid-Career , was <br>the France and Belgium Branch (S2C41).<br>was recognized for <br>a language teacher, multi-linguist, and advocate for the linguist workforce.<br><br>of<br> contributions as<br><br>(S//SI)<br> is widely known around NSA as one of the Agency's premier Dutch<br>linguists and, since his arrival has helped 15 other Dutch linguists achieve professionalization.
